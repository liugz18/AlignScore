Some argue that they are not because they are meant to be performed rather than read. However, others believe that film scripts can have literary merit and should be studied as such. One key difference between plays and screenplays is that screenplays tend to be more focused on visual storytelling, while plays rely more on dialogue and stage directions.","However, others believe that film scripts can have literary merit and should be studied as such.","Idea, draft, edit, final product. Screenplay, film, projection. Manuscript, submit, publish. Is a screenplay actually worth being considered as literature? Yes. And no. Both, actually. Yes, this article will argue in the further parts of this article, because it is a compiled set of words, which (presumably) present a narrative or an idea (as in a theory, but that is another discussion). No, because it is the finished film that truly exists in the realm of literature, with the screenplay serving only as a blueprint. The sketchbook of an artist would not be considered “art” in its complete definition when placed in a gallery of Picasso – but when deliberately presented as “art”, the sketchbook then transcends its position as simply a collection of ideas to be further developed.
A quick, disjointed return to film: film has a language of its own. The screenplay is simply a part of the sketchbook, which contributes to that language and thereby becomes an integral part of the literature of which the film itself is. The same could be argued for the physical film itself (that emulsion-based medium with silver-halide), the splicing tape used to connect different “cuts” on the physical film (or the mouse if using computer editing) etc.
To bring everything that was just written and will be further developed into one central idea: the screenplay, the film script, is simply a part of the literature of film in the same way that a sketchbook or a rough draft is simply a blueprint for an artist’s or a writer’s final product – which becomes labeled as literature.
Let us begin with the distinction that must inevitably be made between a script/screenplay that is made into a film and a script/screenplay that is not made into a film. The former, the script that has been made into a film, is inherently stronger that the latter, the script that has not been made into a film. Why? Because it has the final product to support it; that congealment of images, which bring life to the writing through a visual representation subjected to the director’s interpretation of the script. The Coen Brothers envisioned True Grit in a far different manner than did Henry Hathaway.
Now, the script that has not been made into a film is a weaker piece of work because it does not have that visual association, the image that – when paired with a specific line – will incite a more visceral reaction. Remember when Captain Barbossa said to Elizabeth in Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl “You best start believin’ in ghost stories, Miss Turner. You’re in one.” Now imagine reading that line with no image or context attached other than the prior lines. There is no scene description on the script to create the world seen in the film, as would happen in a novel – a paragraph to describe the surroundings. It is just a collection of dialogue. The effect is severely diminished when compared to the script, which has been given that image, that scene of skeletons under the moonlight. Now that we have covered that strength/weakness disparity between scripts that are now movies and those that are not – we may move on.
Should then the script, in either case, be considered as literature? No, it should not be. As discussed in the opening paragraph, an artist’s sketchbook is simply where the idea has begun. It is not artwork in itself so much as it is a blueprint to build upon. It is the same with film scripts. The script is simply a barebones exhibition of dialogue, which informs the motion of the narrative. A well-written film or theater script will leave out instructions about costume, set-design, props etc. (save for the most significant details). The script thereby becomes simply a collection of dialogue, of call and response. This is not literature anymore than a sketchbook is art. The script becomes a part of the literature of film after the film has been made. Even Shakespeare is not literature until it arrives upon the stage. It is the action that is the literature, with the script serving only as enabler and support.
But what about books that are formatted as film scripts/screenplays? Shouldn’t they be considered literature? Yes, they are literature. But they are not a film scripts in the connotative sense of “script”. Take the book Monster , by Walter Dean Myers. It is a book that has sections formatted as a screenplay – it can be adapted to film quite easily because of this formatting. But it is the “formatting” which is important; this book was released as a book experimenting with style, structure and formatting – it contains sections which are screenplay, sections which are handwritten memoir, and is interspersed by images. It is a book first – a screenplay only by a creative, structural decision made by the author and does not fall into the canon of “film scripts/screenplays”. Returning to an earlier point – this book is the finished product and is not simply the blueprint for a further development (although that doorway remains open).
What remains to argue is whether film scripts actually should be considered literature, connotatively. This article has argued already that no – they should not be considered literature until they have been made into a film . Should, then, the film itself be considered literature? Denotatively, no – it is not a printed material (unless you stretch the definition of a film “print”). But let a request be made that we make an addendum to the connotation of literature (yes, that is a purposefully subjective that statement) to include filmic material within the canon of literature. Why? Film has language. It has a grammar, a semiotic structure – it has signifiers and signified (thank you Saussure!). It can be read and analyzed (albeit not in the same way as written work may be) and brings to life the writing which made that film possible.

Even when powered by the average grid in the United States, which typically includes a mix of fossil fuel and renewable power plants, electric vehicles are almost always much greener than conventional cars. Going solar is another top way to help the environment and save money.",Going solar is another top way to help the environment and save money.,"- Over their lifetime, electric cars are better for the environment than gas-powered cars
- This has been confirmed by wide-ranging studies across many countries
- Along with driving electric, going solar is a top way to help the environment (and save money!) Get started on EnergySage today .
The evidence is clear: from “cradle to grave”, electric cars have lower overall emissions in just about every scenario than their gas-powered counterparts . At the end of 2020, engineering and environmental consultancy firm Ricardo, alongside specialists in the European energy and environmental sector, delivered a conclusive report analyzing the lifecycle emissions of road vehicles. The result? “Our assessment has shown that over their entire life-cycle in the EU, new electric vehicles are expected to have significantly lower impacts on the climate compared to conventional combustion engine vehicles,” said Nikolas Hill, a project manager at Ricardo.
This figure summarizes the key takeaway from the whole report:
The chart above shows the Global Warming Potential (GWP) of battery electric vehicles (BEV) as compared to the GWP of traditional cars in 28 different countries. The furthest column to the left is the GWP for internal combustion engines, the second bar from the left is the GWP for diesel cars, and the third bar from the left is the total pan-European GWP for all battery electric cars. Most notably, in every country except for Estonia, BEVs have a lower (and oftentimes, significantly lower) GWP.
Electric cars get their fuel from the electrical grid. Fun fact about the grid – depending on where you are in the world, the electricity flowing through the wires around you was generated from a wide range of sources, both fossil fuel-based and renewable. For example, in Poland, much of the country’s electricity generation still comes from coal, while in Germany, wind and solar make up a larger share. This means that using electricity from the grid (like when you charge an electric car) can mean a different carbon impact depending on where you are. This is known as carbon intensity , and it is a useful way to compare the electricity mix of different regions and countries. The chart below shows different carbon intensities by country for 2020, as well as projected carbon intensities for 2050:
Estonia has a carbon intensity of 1.02 tonnes of carbon dioxide per megawatt-hour (MWh), making it the highest value in the figure. High carbon intensity means more carbon dioxide per electric vehicle charge, which is why Estonia has such a high GWP.
Where does the U.S. fit into all of this? According to emissionsindex.org , our carbon intensity was somewhere around 898 pounds of carbon dioxide per MWh as of Q3 2020, which translates to roughly 0.41 tonnes/MWh – in the ballpark of countries like Romania, Greece, and Ireland. And in Romania, for example, BEVs have a 50 percent lower GWP than conventional vehicles, indicating that electric cars are well-suited to producing lower overall emissions in the U.S. as well.
A lifecycle analysis, or an LCA , is the backbone of this study. Simply put, a lifecycle analysis takes into consideration all stages of a product, from production to use to disposal and end-of-life. For this study, Ricardo referenced several factors in their LCA, including vehicle production (extraction of raw materials, processing, assembly, painting, etc.), vehicle use (driving, charging, maintenance, etc.), and end-of-life (re-use, recycling, disposal to landfills, etc.):
Lifecycle analyses are important for these types of studies, as it can be easy to underestimate the full scope of impacts a car can have throughout its existence. If you only considered a car’s lifecycle to include the period of time when it is actively driven and used, you’d come up with a much different environmental impact estimate. Production and end-of-life processes for the products we use every day are surprisingly robust, and the environmental impacts from those stages can’t be ignored.
While the Ricardo study is certainly one of the more robust and comprehensive LCA studies on EVs, they’re not alone in their conclusions that EVs are better for the environment. Here are a few more studies that support their claims:
BloombergNEF is Bloomberg’s primary research arm covering transportation, clean energy, and more. In the 2020 version of their annual Electric Vehicle Outlook, the estimate that the total carbon dioxide emissions from battery electric vehicles are far below the emissions from traditional combustion engine vehicles in five major countries:
According to the report, lifecycle carbon dioxide emissions of electric cars produced in 2020 and then driven for 250,000 kilometers are between 18 percent and 87 percent lower than internal combustion vehicles.
Transport & Environment is a leading clean transport advocacy and campaign group in Europe. They release annual reports on electric vehicles and clean transportation, as well as conduct research and advocate for new energy and transportation policies. Their findings mirror the previous two studies: in all countries studied, electric vehicles emitted less carbon dioxide than their gas-powered counterparts:

Willoughby, and others founded the American Political Science Association (APSA). The association's journal, the American Political Science Review (APSR), followed in 1906. Is there anything else you would like to know?","The association's journal, the American Political Science Review (APSR), followed in 1906.","The beginning of American political science as an organized discipline can be dated to December 30, 1903, when John Burgess, Frank Goodnow, Westel W. Willoughby, and others founded the American Political Science Association (APSA). The association's journal, the American Political Science Review ( APSR ), followed in 1906. Even though most schools still lacked separate political science departments, the appearance of the APSA, and thereafter its journal, legitimated professional commitment to political science as a coherent area of study. The APSA gave political scientists, in and out of the university, a sense of common purpose, and the APSR offered an outlet for original research and scholarly exposure.
As the discipline was established, political scientists increasingly incorporated political knowledge as their peculiar domain. Political scientists, after ""authorizing"" themselves through the creation of a discipline, began cordoning off political research as their area of study. The study of politics started to become a professional pursuit, sanctioned by a professional association. This trend toward professionalism in the field of political research became more clear during the behavioral revolution's move to ""pure"" science. With behavioralism, the discipline settled on a scientific identity, an identity that has changed little since its inception. Behavioralism, though, has its roots in the ""science of politics movement,"" which began in the 1920s.
Political scientists believed that a scientific, disciplinary, and professional identity (that is, acceptance as ""legitimate"" producers of knowledge) depended on a common and useful methodology to separate trained ""political scientists"" from methodologically untrained amateurs. Scientific method would allow political scientists to arrive at objective, value-free truth (or truths) about a certain aspect of (usually) American politics in order to aid a modernizing polity in a purely technical way. There could be no normative goals in a value-free science. Political scientists, in other words, should not seek to express what ought to be done. Instead, their goal must be simply to explain the political world.
In the early 1900s, Arthur F. Bentley offered a tool for empirical, value-free social research in his work, The Process of Government: A Study of Social Pressures. Although Bentley was not an academic by trade, he did influence subsequent generations of political scientists, especially those within the behavioralist tradition. In The Process of Government, Bentley wanted to move away from the traditional notions of scientific explanation in society. He considered political science, with its nineteenth-century reliance on formalist studies of institutions, to be dead. The ""barren formalism"" of political science needed to be touched up with the ""glow of humanity"" by studying social actors themselves ""for what they are"" and ""for what they represent"" (Bentley, pp. 163–164). According to Bentley, the ""raw material"" for the scientific study of government cannot be found in one person. It must always be located in ""something doing,"" in the activity of groups, in ""the dispersal of one grouping of forces by another grouping."" And while these groups do consist of thinking and feeling persons, the social scientist knows ""nothing of 'ideas' and 'feelings' except through the medium of actions"" (p. 175–176). Government is a process that is forever in flux, and, as such, it can never be described by law books, law, essays, addresses, or constitutional conventions.
Bentley argued that social science, then, should be empirical, measurable, progressive, and concerned with the interaction and activity of a complex and overlapping system of social, political, and economic groupings. Such a social science could, in Bentley's view, be objective and, as such, achieve ""knowledge."" Most of these aspects are evident again, in the science of politics movement of the 1920s and 1930s and in the behavioral political science that conquered the discipline by the late 1950s. The empirical, measurable, ""progressive,"" and quantified behavioralist tradition gave political science the ""scientific"" identity it had sought since Bentley's era.
The new era in political science that followed World War I, like most new eras in the discipline, repudiated the previous era of political science. Progressive political science was condemned as invalid and partisan, not scientific enough. The new era sought even more detached, scientific, methodical, and therapeutic reforms for what was perceived to be a democracy in crisis. According to post–World War I political scientists, the United States' ""liberal democracy"" emerged badly shaken from the war. Political scientists had supported the war ""for the usual reasons—it was supposed to end European autocracy and thus end war"" (Seidelman and Harpham, p. 102). Instead, emboldened and effective fascist and communist governments in Europe strengthened their abilities to motivate their populaces to act in accordance with government interests. Post–World War I political scientists in America noticed a peculiar lack of any such motivational ability in the United States, and their wrath fell on their immediate predecessors. In their view, reform-minded progressive political scientists had not adequately and systematically located receptive reform publics, and their superficial and hasty analyses and proposals had consequently failed to be effective.
In light of this, political scientists of the new era saw the need for scholarly renovation. They renewed their dedication to establishing scientific inquiry in the hope that ""scientific knowledge would emerge and contribute to improving the quality of public life in America"" (Ricci, p. 77). The professional identity of the political scientist became that of political ""healer,"" and political knowledge, implemented in the governmental system, was to be constructed toward this end. Political scientists such as Charles E. Merriam and Harold D. Lasswell saw themselves as social engineers whose purpose was the ""rational"" supervision of political actors tasked with ordering and controlling a logical and brave new political society. Merriam and Lasswell simply wanted to install a professional identity for political scientists based on a science that was organized to aid the liberal democratic state. As such, political knowledge was to be organized for the same purpose. This is part of the reason why such a formulation of science caught on in the discipline. It was constructed to correspond to the technical needs of society, and therefore it became the accepted identity for political scientists. But after World War II, this identity began to crumble. Behavioralists wanted to purify scientific political knowledge.
According to Albert Somit and Joseph Tanenhaus, numerous factors emerged to help establish behavioralism as a force in political science: Political scientists perceived that they were not considered legitimate scientists and consequently had problems securing research grants; they believed that the other social sciences (particularly psychology) were making broad advances while political science lagged behind; the reformist, normative nature of the discipline was generally considered speculative and unscientific; research technology (including survey techniques, statistical computations, and computers) became much more refined and available; and they pursued a ""pure"" science that operated on the presupposition that democracy is the best system of government because of its open and scientific qualities. In short, post–World War II political scientists sought to define the science of politics from the standpoint that science should be pure. The science of politics should be interested only in explaining the workings of American democracy in order to understand the American system better.
Postwar political scientists believed that political crises remained because pre–World War II political scientists had allowed their reformist aims to occlude their understanding of politics. Many postwar political scientists wanted to embark on the pure scientific project of analyzing the workings of the American system without tainting the analysis with speculative notions of reform. These were the first self-conscious attempts to push normative political theory to the margins of the discipline. The assumption that American democracy is the best political system in the world expels the normative determination of value from the discipline's activities. A pure science, after all, cannot consider such a claim. Rather, it must presuppose its end as it determines how best to reach or enhance it.
Somit and Tanenhaus have combined the various strands of behavioralism into what they term the ""behavioral creed"":
- Political science should search rigorously for regularities in political behavior in order to facilitate prediction and explanation.
- Political science should concern itself with empirical political phenomena, that is, with the behavior of individuals and political groups.
- Data should be quantifiable in order to aid predictive capabilities.
- Research should be theory driven; in other words, research should begin with a theory that yields empirically testable hypotheses.
- Political scientists should avoid applied (reform-minded) research in favor of pure scientific research.
- Values such as democracy, equality, and freedom cannot be scientifically established and should thus be avoided unless they can somehow be made empirically testable.
- Political science should become more interdisciplinary, at least at the behavioral level.
- Political science should place more emphasis on methodology and make better use of multivariate analysis, sample surveys, mathematical models, and simulation.
Behavioralists were intent on building a scientific community that was centered on behavioral inquiry. They could do this by further institutionalizing political knowledge. Therefore, the research skills that behavioral inquiry required served to exclude those who did not possess the proper training and to solidify the scientific identity of political scientists.
One example of behavioral inquiry can be found in the work of David B. Truman, who is probably best known for his book The Governmental Process, first published in 1951, which revived Bentley's group process theory of government. Truman's argument, although less polemical, closely resembles Bentley's and is offered in response to the expanding role of interest groups in American politics and the public's growing fear of their influence. The Governmental Process, by Truman's own account, contributed to the ""political behavior movement"" in political science by increasing ""the analytical strength and usefulness of the discipline"" (pp. xix–xx). It also triggered the growth of the study of interest groups in the United States and abroad. Like Bentley's work, The Governmental Process offers a tool for analysis: a theory to drive systematic behavioral research. It contains many ""testable hypotheses"" ranging from the political orientations of groups to the internal politics of the group process to the influence of groups on the legislature, the executive, the judiciary, and elections.
Truman's basic argument revolves around the notion that because every individual attempts to become an accepted participant in a group or a set of groups, it makes sense to study political behavior in terms of groups and group interactions. He argues that ""the patterns of action and attitude among individuals will differ from one another in large measure according to the clusters of group affiliations that the individuals have"" (p. 16). Individuals define themselves based on the opportunities that groups afford. In Truman's words, ""It appears … that the group experiences and affiliations of an individual are the primary, though not the exclusive, means by which the individual knows, interprets, and reacts to the society in which he [sic] exists"" (p. 21). Like Merriam, Truman believed that society had become sufficiently complex to necessitate an interdependent approach to the analysis of political behavior and government. In other words, any social or political action involves a complicated series of interactions, particularly at the group level, that affect individuals and the government. With this in mind, the purpose of Truman's book was to analyze rigorously both the operations of representative government in the United States and the character of groups' relationships with the governing process. He does not desire progressive reform; his research seeks ""pure"" explanation.
Another behavioralist, Heinz Eulau, openly criticized the reformist (""utopian"") political science of the pre–World War II era. In his 1969 book, Behavioralism in Political Science, Eulau argued that science can function only ""in an environment that permits freedom of inquiry and freedom of speech"" (p. 12). American liberal democracy allows such freedoms and thus is most suitable for scientific work. Political science can never undermine liberal democracy, as David M. Ricci reported that pre–World War II political scientists feared. Political scientists assumed, then, that American democracy must be alive and well as they pursued the new, nonreformist, scientific goal of analyzing and explaining the ways in which the American political system functioned.
The dominance of the behavioral approach to studying politics was seen in the field of international relations as well, which tended to personify states and study their ""behavior."" This approach has been seen most clearly in realist and neorealist research in international politics. The field of comparative politics was also affected by the behavioral shift, as its practitioners abandoned the field's legal-institutional approach in favor of a more quantitative analysis. Instead of simply explaining the similarities of and the differences between political institutions across culture and context, behaviorally inclined comparative politics scholars sought to ground such institutional differences and similarities in ""universal"" terms of political behavior. The field of normative political theory was largely immune to the behavioral revolution and operated as a critic from without, which ultimately served to marginalize it from the accepted approach of the discipline. Postbehavioralism altered this situation in some important ways. All of the various subfields of study were opened to other methodological approaches, and political theory moved in a bit from the margins. Still, the scientific mood was not fundamentally altered.
In 1967 the Caucus for a New Political Science was organized as a response to behavioral hegemony. Behavioral discourse, pro and con, dominated the discipline's mainstream by the mid-1960s in terms of method, language, and research focus. Members of the caucus lamented the limited scope of behavioral inquiry. Behavioralism, they argued, neglected too many possible points of view; it was too ""parochial."" The caucus desired a more open and expansive discipline. In 1969 David Easton responded to the aims of the caucus in his presidential address to the APSA. Easton coined the term postbehavioralism and made relevance and action its watchwords. Postbehavioralists, Easton argued, wanted to make political science more relevant to and active in society.
Ultimately, new areas of research were opened up within the discipline (for instance, the Vietnam War, race relations, poverty, and women's rights), and the well-populated, university-centered discipline became specialized. Political scientists increasingly carved up special areas of the discipline for themselves, each area with a special language and technique that made intercommunication difficult and often without purpose. These subfields rapidly grew into self-contained entities within the field of political science.
During this era of fragmentation, antibehavioral forces found new voices. Research that was distinctly anti-or nonbehavioral found legitimacy as the discipline's professional identity evolved away from its behavioral parochialism. The discipline became more tolerant of various perspectives on politics and political science during the postbehavioral era. The intellectual ""community"" that behavioralism constructed in the discipline of political science collapsed during the 1970s, the decade that witnessed the fragmentation of the discipline's research agenda. This transpired for at least three reasons: (1) the Caucus for a New Political Science's effectiveness at forcing the field to open up to more research interests; (2) the population explosion that occurred in the discipline following World War II, which increased the competition for recognition among political scientists; and (3) a related mood of openness that prevailed in the discipline following the closed and parochial behavioral era.
Because political scientists were generally required to publish in order to advance the accumulation of knowledge that ""scientific communities"" need, and because the range of suitable research topics was limited during the behavioral era while the population of the discipline was rapidly increasing, the discipline was quickly saturated. Political scientists sought new areas of expertise and the discipline opened up, allowing for the creation of many new subfields. The topics covered by these new subfields were so diverse by 1977 that Nelson Polsby, the managing editor of the APSR at the time, ""conceded that no editor could 'judge the quality of manuscripts over the full range of concerns that political scientists write about'"" (quoted in Ricci, pp. 222–223).
The discipline has become so complicated that even political scientists are unable to comprehend completely or become comfortable with its entire range of research. So much material is published in increasingly narrow fields that political scholars find it difficult to keep up with their own subfields, much less understand and integrate other subfields. Specialties and subspecialties continually emerge, and a broader base of expertise results. Each subfield churns out vast quantities of literature, and the literature from each subfield, taken together, is more than any one researcher can master. Nevertheless, one researcher can become an ""expert"" in the work of one subfield. Therefore, the discipline does not consist of ""experts"" in political knowledge (a central tenet of the APSA); it consists of ""experts"" in certain aspects of political knowledge. But while political scientists from different subfields find communication difficult, the notion of a common purpose (the construction of a body of political knowledge) remains.
In the early twenty-first century, however, the claim to this common purpose has come under some scrutiny by a new movement within the discipline called ""Perestroika."" The Perestroika movement, begun anonymously in 2000, calls attention to two problems in the discipline: its lack of inclusiveness and its increasingly mathematical approach. In many ways, this movement revives the thinking behind the Caucus for a New Political Science movement in its concern for the apparent irrelevance of the discipline in the wider political context and its criticism of an increasingly quantitative orientation within the discipline. Those active in the Perestroika movement consistently point to the growing preponderance of rational choice approaches to studying politics, which, in their view, are becoming hegemonic within the discipline as departments re-populate themselves with scholars using rational choice methodologies in their research. While the Perestroika movement has witnessed some success (such as the founding of a new journal that promises to be more methodologically inclusive), it is not at all clear that it will succeed in altering the increasingly quantitative orientation of the discipline.",source_text/bf3c425bb1c3f5a21a04ce88ed12f16b16c1d205b168c5fe31ccc0cbfb23a5f6-bing_chat_0_0.txt,"The association's journal, the American Political Science Review (APSR), followed in 1906.",complete_support,False,song - sang - wrote - sings - movie - played - plays - blood - released - original,StanfordCitation,0.83,0.5966666666666666,0.49,0.47,[0.9794149994850159],[0.9794149994850159]

There are myriad reasons for the inflation—which hit a 40-year high in June—and President Joe Biden is reportedly considering lifting tariffs on some Chinese goods to rein it in.
Biden, who has called inflation “the bane of our existence,” said in May that his administration is evaluating how to best move forward on existing tariffs on China. The tariffs of up to 25% , which former President Donald Trump slapped on China as part of a trade war, cover hundreds of billions of dollars worth of Chinese imports.
China Walks Back Diplomat’s Apparent Questioning of Ex-Soviet States’ Independence
Posted 12 Days Ago
Higher prices will be on the minds of American voters in midterm elections in November, and virtual talks between China’s Vice Premier Liu He and U.S. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen on July 5 fueled speculation that tariffs could be lifted soon.
“With high inflation becoming a politically toxic issue, the Biden administration is clearly eager to take whatever policy actions are under its purview to corral rising prices,” says Eswar Prasad , a professor of economics and trade policy at Cornell University and the former head of the IMF’s China Division. “The imperative of doing whatever is possible to rein in inflation is probably overriding concerns about any political blowback from the perception of a softening of U.S. policies towards China,” he adds.
But will Biden actually lift the tariffs, and would that help the American consumer? Here’s what to know.
The White House said on Tuesday that it is still considering its options, and it appears to be split on the issue. Yellen said this month that some cuts might be warranted and that some of the tariffs “ended up being paid by Americans, not by the Chinese, hurt American consumers and businesses.”
But U.S. trade representative Katherine Tai told a Senate subcommittee in late June that it was important to protect U.S. trade interests. “The China tariffs are…a significant piece of leverage, and a trade negotiator never walks away from leverage,” she said.
The U.S. Trade Representative’s office had received more than 400 requests to keep tariffs on Chinese goods in place, including from a committee of 24 labor unions, as of late Tuesday, according to Reuters .
“Strong pressure is coming from U.S. labor unions to continue the tariffs, fearing job losses due to increased outsourcing of manufacturing to China,” says Doug Barry, an official at the non-profit U.S.-China Business Council, which represents about 200 companies that trade and do business with China.
But he adds that there is evidence that the tariffs have actually caused domestic job losses in some industries. “Weakened demand for China imports means less economic activity generated by those imports: fewer truck drivers, salespeople, accountants, and less tax revenue for local governments where the U.S. companies do business,” he says.
Even if the government does lift tariffs, the changes might not be substantial.
Clete Willems, a former top White House trade negotiator, told CNBC’s Squawk Box Asia on Wednesday that moves to lift some China tariffs would likely be “modest”— perhaps $10 billion out of over $360 billion that are currently being imposed on China—in the short-term.
Removing all of the tariffs would have a modest effect, reducing prices of many products, says David Dollar, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution. “Some of that would work via supply chains as U.S. firms import a lot of components from China and eliminating the tariffs would make the chains operate more smoothly.”
But any tariff reductions are likely to be focused on consumer goods such as electronics “where any price reductions might be most visible to consumers,” says Prasad, of Cornell. But, he says, “it is not obvious that the tariff reductions will pass through into lower prices at a time of strong consumer demand.”
A Peterson Institute for International Economics study published in June said that a broad trade liberalization would save American households an average of $797. But trade representative Tai criticized the study, calling it “something between fiction or an interesting academic exercise” and Yellen has warned that cuts would not be a “panacea” for easing high inflation.
That means that a potential tariff reduction might not give the Biden administration the political boost it wants.
There is a risk that “reductions in tariffs might at best have a limited and delayed impact on inflation, and would highlight the government’s impotence in managing inflation with the very limited policy tools at its disposal,” says Prasad. “Clearly, a tariff reduction would benefit both countries, but reducing tariffs without any concessions or commitments from China could result in unpalatably high political costs for the Biden administration relative to the economic benefits.”
Still, Barry says that members of the U.S.-China Business Council oppose the tariffs, “because they do more harm than good.” He says lifting tariffs would be meaningful for U.S. companies as some firms have “paid hundreds of millions of dollars in extra tariff fees to the U.S. Treasury.” He cites one of the last loudspeaker makers in the U.S., which complains that his products are no longer competitive because of the 25% tariffs on some components he imports from China.
Says Barry: “We want them all lifted, reciprocated by China, and negotiations restarted immediately on resolving the growing list of trade and other disagreements between the two largest economies in the world.”

Some people believe that inherited wealth should be taxed at higher rates than earned income to promote meritocracy. Others argue that wealth transfers, including inheritance, are an important economic force. A significant portion of wealth is inherited rather than self-made, and inherited wealth tends to concentrate among the ultra-rich.","A significant portion of wealth is inherited rather than self-made, and inherited wealth tends to concentrate among the ultra-rich.","President Obama has called for higher taxes on capital gains , to generate revenue to help middle and lower-income families. Is there also a social mobility case for action?
One specific proposal has gained a lot of attention: closing a loophole in our laws concerning inheritance. Currently, any capital gains accrued over a person’s lifetime are not taxed when the person dies, because the value of the assets is “stepped up” at death, creating a new basis for one’s heirs. Say your billionaire father bought a tract of land in 1950 for $200,000. Now he passes away and the land is worth $3,000,000. You inherit the land. The “stepped up basis” rule means that—if you sell the land—you pay capital gains tax on any appreciation above $3,000,000, not on appreciation above the original value, $200,000. So if you sell the land immediately, you will pay no capital gains tax. Without this loophole, you’d pay a 23.8% capital gains tax on the $2,800,000 in appreciation; the government would get $666,400, and you’d leave with $2,333,600.
The President exempted closely-held family farms and businesses along with any appreciation in the value of one’s principal residence, to ensure that the proposal targets only the truly wealthy. The rule means a lot of lost revenue: in 2012, the OMB estimated that “stepped-up basis” would cost the government $400 billion over 5 years.
The Washington Post’s Matt O’Brien aptly sees the proposal as evidence of “ Obama’s Piketty moment .” Given Republican opposition, the chances for the proposal are vanishingly small. But there is a good case for it beyond sensible fiscal policy: the nation’s limited social mobility and increasing concentrations of both income and wealth.
The fear of Piketty and others is that rising income inequality over the last four decades will eventually lead to greater wealth inequality as the “haves” are able to sock away larger amounts of savings, while the “have-nots” increasingly struggle to do so. With greater concentrations of wealth will come bigger inheritances, as the richest Americans pass on fortunes to their children. Intergenerational social mobility could decline, as inherited wealth grows in importance relative to self-made wealth.
Are the Piketty fears justified? Three warning signs suggest they might be:
- Wealth concentration . The share of total wealth owned by the top 0.1 percent increased from 7 percent in late 1970 to 22 percent in 2012, according to a new paper by Emmanuel Saez and Gabriel Zucman:
Source: Saez and Zucman, “Weath Inequality in the United States Since 1913: Evidence from Capitalized Income Tax Data,” NBER Working Paper, 2014.
- Inheritance Matters . An estimated 35 to 45 percent of wealth is inherited rather than self-made, according to Kopczuk’s review of the literature .
- Inheritance Could Hurt Mobility , especially when combined with the other advantages that wealthy parents provide their children (such as more engaged parenting, better schooling, help with paying for college or investing in a home, and all kinds of social capital or useful connections). As Richard Reeves argues, wealth could help to create a “glass floor” , below which children in privileged families cannot fall.
An obvious way to reduce intergenerational transfers of wealth is to increase taxes on inheritances. Currently, inherited wealth can be passed tax-free to a surviving spouse, and then on to one’s children unless the estate is larger than $5,430,000. (Above this amount, estates are taxed at 40 percent.)
Because the exemption is so generous, less than 1 percent of all estates are ever subject to the tax, and even non-exempt people leave large amounts of money to their children. With the retirement of the baby boomers beginning, trillions of dollars hang in the balance. The President’s proposal to tax capital gains at death, although administratively complicated because of the need to keep track of the initial basis, would help to whittle some of these bequests down to size.
Republicans have been intent on eliminating the estate tax entirely and succeeded in lowering it during the 2000s. The top rate fell from 55% in 2001 to 35% in 2012. The top rate rose to 40% as part of the “fiscal cliff” deal. But the exemption jumped from $675,000 in 2001 to $5,430,000 in 2015. Growing concerns about social mobility on both sides of the aisle make the issue of inherited wealth a topic that should be on the agenda.
Republicans, in particular, have been eloquent about the ability of each generation, with only modest help from their parents or the larger society, to make it on their own. And as the Gates family has argued, the very wealthy should be willing to repay society for the many benefits they have derived from being born in the U.S. Yes, hard work and risk-taking often lie behind large fortunes, but they also reflect the luck of the draw and should not be allowed to create a Downton Abbey society in our midst.",source_text/f9d9ddf5a54b948df8a847c0aa2f820d155e825f1e25f77a67a0fdef2f502e04-perplexity_3_0.txt,"An estimated 35 to 45 percent of wealth is inherited rather than self-made,

This article is about the 1798/99 resolutions against the Alien and Sedition Acts. For the 1765 resolves against the Stamp Act, see Virginia Resolves .
The Virginia and Kentucky Resolutions were political statements drafted in 1798 and 1799 in which the Kentucky and Virginia legislatures took the position that the federal Alien and Sedition Acts were unconstitutional. The resolutions argued that the states had the right and the duty to declare unconstitutional those acts of Congress that the Constitution did not authorize. In doing so, they argued for states' rights and strict construction of the Constitution. The Kentucky and Virginia Resolutions of 1798 were written secretly by Vice President Thomas Jefferson and James Madison , respectively.
The principles stated in the resolutions became known as the "" Principles of '98 "". Adherents argued that the states could judge the constitutionality of central government laws and decrees. The Kentucky Resolutions of 1798 argued that each individual state has the power to declare that federal laws are unconstitutional and void. The Kentucky Resolution of 1799 added that when the states determine that a law is unconstitutional, nullification by the states is the proper remedy. The Virginia Resolutions of 1798 refer to "" interposition "" to express the idea that the states have a right to ""interpose"" to prevent harm caused by unconstitutional laws. The Virginia Resolutions contemplated joint action by the states.
The Resolutions were produced primarily as campaign material for the 1800 United States presidential election and had been controversial since their passage, eliciting disapproval from ten state legislatures. Ron Chernow assessed the theoretical damage of the resolutions as ""deep and lasting ... a recipe for disunion"". [1] George Washington was so appalled by them that he told Patrick Henry that if ""systematically and pertinaciously pursued"", they would ""dissolve the union or produce coercion"". [1] Their influence reverberated right up to the Civil War and beyond. [2] In the years leading up to the Nullification Crisis , the resolutions divided Jeffersonian democrats , with states' rights proponents such as John C. Calhoun supporting the Principles of '98 and President Andrew Jackson opposing them. Years later, the passage of the Fugitive Slave Act of 1850 led anti-slavery activists to quote the Resolutions to support their calls on Northern states to nullify what they considered unconstitutional enforcement of the law. [3]
The resolutions opposed the federal Alien and Sedition Acts , which extended the powers of the federal government . They argued that the Constitution was a "" compact "" or agreement among the states. Therefore, the federal government had no right to exercise powers not specifically delegated to it. If the federal government assumed such powers, its acts could be declared unconstitutional by the states. So, states could decide the constitutionality of laws passed by Congress . Kentucky's Resolution 1 stated:
That the several states composing the United States of America are not united on the principle of unlimited submission to their general government; but that, by compact, under the style and title of a Constitution for the United States, and of amendments thereto, they constituted a general government for special purposes, delegated to that government certain definite powers, reserving, each state to itself, the residuary mass of right to their own self-government; and that whensoever the general government assumes undelegated powers, its acts are unauthoritative, void, and of no force; that to this compact each state acceded as a state, and is an integral party, its co-States forming, as to itself, the other party; that this government, created by this compact, was not made the exclusive or final judge of the extent of the powers delegated to itself, since that would have made its discretion, and not the Constitution, the measure of its powers; but that, as in all other cases of compact among powers having no common judge, each party has an equal right to judge for itself, as well of infractions as of the mode and measure of redress.
A key provision of the Kentucky Resolutions was Resolution 2, which denied Congress more than a few penal powers by arguing that Congress had no authority to punish crimes other than those specifically named in the Constitution. The Alien and Sedition Acts were asserted to be unconstitutional, and therefore void, because they dealt with crimes not mentioned in the Constitution:
That the Constitution of the United States, having delegated to Congress a power to punish treason, counterfeiting the securities and current coin of the United States, piracies, and felonies committed on the high seas, and offenses against the law of nations, and no other crimes, whatsoever; and it being true as a general principle, and one of the amendments to the Constitution having also declared, that ""the powers not delegated to the United States by the Constitution, nor prohibited by it to the States, are reserved to the States respectively, or to the people,"" therefore the act of Congress, passed on the 14th day of July, 1798, and intitled ""An Act in addition to the act intitled An Act for the punishment of certain crimes against the United States,"" as also the act passed by them on the—day of June, 1798, intitled ""An Act to punish frauds committed on the bank of the United States,"" (and all their other acts which assume to create, define, or punish crimes, other than those so enumerated in the Constitution,) are altogether void, and of no force whatsoever.
The Virginia Resolution of 1798 also relied on the compact theory and asserted that the states have the right to determine whether actions of the federal government exceed constitutional limits. The Virginia Resolution introduced the idea that the states may ""interpose"" when the federal government acts unconstitutionally, in their opinion:
That this Assembly doth explicitly and peremptorily declare, that it views the powers of the federal government as resulting from the compact to which the states are parties, as limited by the plain sense and intention of the instrument constituting that compact, as no further valid than they are authorized by the grants enumerated in that compact; and that, in case of a deliberate, palpable, and dangerous exercise of other powers, not granted by the said compact, the states, who are parties thereto, have the right, and are in duty bound, to interpose, for arresting the progress of the evil, and for maintaining, within their respective limits, the authorities, rights and liberties, appertaining to them.
There were two sets of Kentucky Resolutions . The Kentucky state legislature passed the first resolution on November 16, 1798 and the second on December 3, 1799. Jefferson wrote the 1798 Resolutions. The author of the 1799 Resolutions is not known with certainty. [4] Both resolutions were stewarded by John Breckinridge who was falsely believed to have been their author. [5]
James Madison wrote the Virginia Resolution . The Virginia state legislature passed it on December 24, 1798.
The Kentucky Resolutions of 1798 stated that acts of the national government beyond the scope of its constitutional powers are ""unauthoritative, void, and of no force"". While Jefferson's draft of the 1798 Resolutions had claimed that each state has a right of "" nullification "" of unconstitutional laws, [6] that language did not appear in the final form of those Resolutions. Rather than purporting to nullify the Alien and Sedition Acts, the 1798 Resolutions called on the other states to join Kentucky ""in declaring these acts void and of no force"" and ""in requesting their repeal at the next session of Congress"".
The Kentucky Resolutions of 1799 were written to respond to the states who had rejected the 1798 Resolutions. The 1799 Resolutions used the term "" nullification "", which had been deleted from Jefferson's draft of the 1798 Resolutions, resolving: ""That the several states who formed [the Constitution], being sovereign and independent, have the unquestionable right to judge of its infraction; and, That a nullification, by those sovereignties, of all unauthorized acts done under color of that instrument, is the rightful remedy."" The 1799 Resolutions did not assert that Kentucky would unilaterally refuse to enforce the Alien and Sedition Acts. Rather, the 1799 Resolutions declared that Kentucky ""will bow to the laws of the Union"" but would continue ""to oppose in a constitutional manner"" the Alien and Sedition Acts. The 1799 Resolutions concluded by stating that Kentucky was entering its ""solemn protest"" against those Acts.
The Virginia Resolution did not refer to ""nullification"", but instead used the idea of "" interposition "" by the states. The Resolution stated that when the national government acts beyond the scope of the Constitution, the states ""have the right, and are in duty bound, to interpose, for arresting the progress of the evil, and for maintaining, within their respective limits, the authorities, rights and liberties, appertaining to them"". The Virginia Resolution did not indicate what form this ""interposition"" might take or what effect it would have. The Virginia Resolutions appealed to the other states for agreement and cooperation.
Numerous scholars (including Koch and Ammon) have noted that Madison had the words ""void, and of no force or effect"" excised from the Virginia Resolutions before adoption. Madison later explained that he did this because an individual state does not have the right to declare a federal law null and void. Rather, Madison explained that ""interposition"" involved a collective action of the states, not a refusal by an individual state to enforce federal law, and that the deletion of the words ""void, and of no force or effect"" was intended to make clear that no individual state could nullify federal law. [7]
The Kentucky Resolutions of 1799, while claiming the right of nullification, did not assert that individual states could exercise that right. Rather, nullification was described as an action to be taken by ""the several states"" who formed the Constitution. The Kentucky Resolutions thus ended up proposing joint action, as did the Virginia Resolution. [8]
The Resolutions joined the foundational beliefs of Jefferson's party and were used as party documents in the 1800 election. As they had been shepherded to passage in the Virginia House of Delegates by John Taylor of Caroline , [9] they became part of the heritage of the "" Old Republicans "". Taylor rejoiced in what the House of Delegates had made of Madison's draft: it had read the claim that the Alien and Sedition Acts were unconstitutional as meaning that they had ""no force or effect"" in Virginia—that is, that they were void. Future Virginia Governor and U.S. Secretary of War James Barbour concluded that ""unconstitutional"" included ""void, and of no force or effect"", and that Madison's textual change did not affect the meaning. Madison himself strongly denied this reading of the Resolution. [10]
The long-term importance of the Resolutions lies not in their attack on the Alien and Sedition Acts , but rather in their strong statements of states' rights theory, which led to the rather different concepts of nullification and interposition . [11]
The resolutions were submitted to the other states for approval, but with no success. Seven states formally responded to Kentucky and Virginia by rejecting the Resolutions [12] and three other states passed resolutions expressing disapproval, [13] with the other four states taking no action. No other state affirmed the resolutions. At least six states responded to the Resolutions by taking the position that the constitutionality of acts of Congress is a question for the federal courts, not the state legislatures. For example, Vermont's resolution stated: ""It belongs not to state legislatures to decide on the constitutionality of laws made by the general government; this power being exclusively vested in the judiciary courts of the Union."" [14] In New Hampshire , newspapers treated them as military threats and replied with foreshadowings of civil war. ""We think it highly probable that Virginia and Kentucky will be sadly disappointed in their infernal plan of exciting insurrections and tumults,"" proclaimed one. The state legislature's unanimous reply was blunt:
Resolved , That the legislature of New Hampshire unequivocally express a firm resolution to maintain and defend the Constitution of the United States, and the Constitution of this state, against every aggression, either foreign or domestic, and that they will support the government of the United States in all measures warranted by the former. That the state legislatures are not the proper tribunals to determine the constitutionality of the laws of the general government; that the duty of such decision is properly and exclusively confided to the judicial department. [15]
Alexander Hamilton , then building up the army, suggested sending it into Virginia, on some ""obvious pretext"". Measures would be taken, Hamilton hinted to an ally in Congress, ""to act upon the laws and put Virginia to the Test of resistance"". [16] At the Virginia General Assembly, delegate John Mathews was said to have objected to the passing of the resolutions by ""tearing them into pieces and trampling them underfoot."" [17]
In January 1800, the Virginia General Assembly passed the Report of 1800 , a document written by Madison to respond to criticism of the Virginia Resolution by other states. The Report of 1800 reviewed and affirmed each part of the Virginia Resolution, affirming that the states have the right to declare that a federal action is unconstitutional. The Report went on to assert that a declaration of unconstitutionality by a state would be an expression of opinion, without legal effect. The purpose of such a declaration, said Madison, was to mobilize public opinion and to elicit cooperation from other states. Madison indicated that the power to make binding constitutional determinations remained in the federal courts:
It has been said, that it belongs to the judiciary of the United States, and not the state legislatures, to declare the meaning of the Federal Constitution. ... [T]he declarations of [the citizens or the state legislature], whether affirming or denying the constitutionality of measures of the Federal Government ... are expressions of opinion, unaccompanied with any other effect than what they may produce on opinion, by exciting reflection. The expositions of the judiciary, on the other hand, are carried into immediate effect by force. The former may lead to a change in the legislative expression of the general will; possibly to a change in the opinion of the judiciary; the latter enforces the general will, whilst that will and that opinion continue unchanged. [18]
Madison then argued that a state, after declaring a federal law unconstitutional, could take action by communicating with other states, attempting to enlist their support, petitioning Congress to repeal the law in question, introducing amendments to the Constitution in Congress, or calling a constitutional convention.
However, in the same document Madison explicitly argued that the states retain the ultimate power to decide about the constitutionality of the federal laws, in ""extreme cases"" such as the Alien and Sedition Act. The Supreme Court can decide in the last resort only in those cases which pertain to the acts of other branches of the federal government, but cannot takeover the ultimate decision-making power from the states which are the ""sovereign parties"" in the Constitutional compact. According to Madison states could override not only the Congressional acts, but also the decisions of the Supreme Court:
Madison later strongly denied that individual states have the right to nullify federal law. [20]
Although the New England states rejected the Kentucky and Virginia Resolutions in 1798–99, several years later, the state governments of Massachusetts , Connecticut , and Rhode Island threatened to ignore the Embargo Act of 1807 based on the authority of states to stand up to laws deemed by those states to be unconstitutional. Rhode Island justified its position on the embargo act based on the explicit language of interposition . However, none of these states actually passed a resolution nullifying the Embargo Act. Instead, they challenged it in court, appealed to Congress for its repeal, and proposed several constitutional amendments.
Several years later, Massachusetts and Connecticut asserted their right to test constitutionality when instructed to send their militias to defend the coast during the War of 1812 . Connecticut and Massachusetts questioned another embargo passed in 1813. Both states objected, including this statement from the Massachusetts legislature, or General Court:
A power to regulate commerce is abused, when employed to destroy it; and a manifest and voluntary abuse of power sanctions the right of resistance , as much as a direct and palpable usurpation. The sovereignty reserved to the states, was reserved to protect the citizens from acts of violence by the United States, as well as for purposes of domestic regulation. We spurn the idea that the free, sovereign and independent State of Massachusetts is reduced to a mere municipal corporation, without power to protect its people, and to defend them from oppression, from whatever quarter it comes. Whenever the national compact is violated, and the citizens of this State are oppressed by cruel and unauthorized laws, this Legislature is bound to interpose its power, and wrest from the oppressor its victim. [21]
Massachusetts and Connecticut, along with representatives of some other New England states, held a convention in 1814 that issued a statement asserting the right of interposition. But the statement did not attempt to nullify federal law. Rather, it made an appeal to Congress to provide for the defense of New England and proposed several constitutional amendments.
During the "" nullification crisis "" of 1828–1833, South Carolina passed an Ordinance of Nullification purporting to nullify two federal tariff laws. South Carolina asserted that the Tariff of 1828 and the Tariff of 1832 were beyond the authority of the Constitution, and therefore were ""null, void, and no law, nor binding upon this State, its officers or citizens"". Andrew Jackson issued a proclamation against the doctrine of nullification, stating: ""I consider ... the power to annul a law of the United States, assumed by one State, incompatible with the existence of the Union, contradicted expressly by the letter of the Constitution, unauthorized by its spirit, inconsistent with every principle on which it was founded, and destructive of the great object for which it was formed."" He also denied the right to secede: ""The Constitution ... forms a government not a league. ... To say that any State may at pleasure secede from the Union is to say that the United States is not a nation."" [22]
James Madison also opposed South Carolina's position on nullification. Madison argued that he had never intended his Virginia Resolution to suggest that each individual state had the power to nullify an act of Congress. Madison wrote: ""But it follows, from no view of the subject, that a nullification of a law of the U. S. can as is now contended, belong rightfully to a single State, as one of the parties to the Constitution; the State not ceasing to avow its adherence to the Constitution. A plainer contradiction in terms, or a more fatal inlet to anarchy, cannot be imagined."" Madison explained that when the Virginia Legislature passed the Virginia Resolution, the ""interposition"" it contemplated was ""a concurring and cooperating interposition of the States, not that of a single State. ... [T]he Legislature expressly disclaimed the idea that a declaration of a State, that a law of the U. S. was unconstitutional, had the effect of annulling the law."" [20] Madison went on to argue that the purpose of the Virginia Resolution had been to elicit cooperation by the other states in seeking change through means provided in the Constitution, such as amendment.
The Supreme Court rejected the compact theory in several nineteenth century cases, undermining the basis for the Kentucky and Virginia resolutions. In cases such as Martin v. Hunter's Lessee , [23] McCulloch v. Maryland , [24] and Texas v. White , [25] the Court asserted that the Constitution was established directly by the people, rather than being a compact among the states. Abraham Lincoln also rejected the compact theory saying the Constitution was a binding contract among the states and no contract can be changed unilaterally by one party.
In 1954, the Supreme Court decided Brown v. Board of Education , which ruled that segregated schools violate the Constitution. Many people in southern states strongly opposed the Brown decision. James J. Kilpatrick , an editor of the Richmond News Leader , wrote a series of editorials urging ""massive resistance"" to integration of the schools. Kilpatrick, relying on the Virginia Resolution, revived the idea of interposition by the states as a constitutional basis for resisting federal government action. [26] A number of southern states, including Arkansas, Louisiana, Virginia, and Florida, subsequently passed interposition and nullification laws in an effort to prevent integration of their schools.
In the case of Cooper v. Aaron , [27] the Supreme Court unanimously rejected Arkansas' effort to use nullification and interposition . The Supreme Court held that under the Supremacy Clause , federal law was controlling and the states did not have the power to evade the application of federal law. The Court specifically rejected the contention that Arkansas' legislature and governor had the power to nullify the Brown decision.
In a similar case arising from Louisiana's interposition act, Bush v. Orleans Parish School Board , [28] the Supreme Court affirmed the decision of a federal district court that rejected interposition. The district court stated: ""The conclusion is clear that interposition is not a constitutional doctrine. If taken seriously, it is illegal defiance of constitutional authority. Otherwise, 'it amounted to no more than a protest, an escape valve through which the legislators blew off steam to relieve their tensions.' ... However solemn or spirited, interposition resolutions have no legal efficacy."" [29]
Merrill Peterson , Jefferson's otherwise very favorable biographer, emphasizes the negative long-term impact of the Resolutions, calling them ""dangerous"" and a product of ""hysteria"":
Called forth by oppressive legislation of the national government, notably the Alien and Sedition Laws, they represented a vigorous defense of the principles of freedom and self-government under the United States Constitution. But since the defense involved an appeal to principles of state rights, the resolutions struck a line of argument potentially as dangerous to the Union as were the odious laws to the freedom with which it was identified. One hysteria tended to produce another. A crisis of freedom threatened to become a crisis of Union. The latter was deferred in 1798–1800, but it would return, and when it did the principles Jefferson had invoked against the Alien and Sedition Laws would sustain delusions of state sovereignty fully as violent as the Federalist delusions he had combated. [30]
Jefferson's biographer Dumas Malone argued that the Kentucky resolution might have gotten Jefferson impeached for treason, had his actions become known at the time. [31] In writing the Kentucky Resolutions, Jefferson warned that, ""unless arrested at the threshold"", the Alien and Sedition Acts would ""necessarily drive these states into revolution and blood."" Historian Ron Chernow says of this ""he wasn't calling for peaceful protests or civil disobedience: he was calling for outright rebellion, if needed, against the federal government of which he was vice president."" Jefferson ""thus set forth a radical doctrine of states' rights that effectively undermined the constitution."" [1] Chernow argues that neither Jefferson nor Madison sensed that they had sponsored measures as inimical as the Alien and Sedition Acts themselves. [1] Historian Garry Wills argued ""Their nullification effort, if others had picked it up, would have been a greater threat to freedom than the misguided [alien and sedition] laws, which were soon rendered feckless by ridicule and electoral pressure"". [32] The theoretical damage of the Kentucky and Virginia resolutions was ""deep and lasting, and was a recipe for disunion"". [1] George Washington was so appalled by them that he told Patrick Henry that if ""systematically and pertinaciously pursued"", they would ""dissolve the union or produce coercion"". [1] The influence of Jefferson's doctrine of states' rights reverberated right up to the Civil War and beyond. [2] Future president James Garfield , at the close of the Civil War, said that Jefferson's Kentucky Resolution ""contained the germ of nullification and secession, and we are today reaping the fruits"".

Cash value insurance is permanent life insurance because it provides coverage for the policyholder’s life. Traditionally, cash value life insurance has higher premiums than term life insurance because of the cash value element. Most cash value life insurance policies require a fixed-level premium payment, of which a portion is allocated to the cost of insurance and the remaining deposited into a cash value account.

The cash value of life insurance earns a modest rate of interest, with taxes deferred on the accumulated earnings. Thus, the cash value of life insurance will increase over time . As the life insurance cash value increases, the insurance company’s risk decreases, because the accumulated cash value offsets part of the insurer’s liability.
Consider a policy with a $25,000 death benefit. The policy has no outstanding loans or prior cash withdrawals and an accumulated cash value of $5,000. Upon the death of the policyholder, the insurance company pays the full death benefit of $25,000. Money collected into the cash value is now the property of the insurer.
Because the cash value is $5,000, the real liability cost to the life insurance company is $20,000 ($25,000 – $5,000).
Whole life , variable life , and universal life insurance are all examples of cash value life insurance. Term insurance is not cash value insurance.
The cash value component serves as a living benefit for policyholders from which they may draw funds. The life insurance net cash value is what the policyholder or their beneficiary has left over once the insurance company deducts its fees or any expenses incurred during the ownership of the policy. There are several options for accessing funds. For most policies, partial surrenders or withdrawals are permissible but these can reduce the death benefit.
Taxes are deferred on earnings until withdrawn from the policy and distributed. Once distributed, earnings are taxable at the policyholder’s standard tax rate. Some policies allow for unlimited withdrawals, while others restrict how many draws can be taken during a term or calendar year. Some policies limit the amounts available for removal (e.g., a minimum of $500).
Most cash value life insurance arrangements allow for loans from the cash value. Much as with any other loan, the issuer will charge interest on the outstanding principal. The outstanding loan amount will reduce the death benefit dollar for dollar in the event of the death of the policyholder before the full repayment of the loan. Some insurers require the repayment of loan interest, and, if unpaid, they may deduct the interest from the remaining cash value.
3
Cash value may also be used to pay policy premiums. If there is a sufficient amount, a policyholder can stop paying premiums out of pocket and have the cash value account cover the payment
Can borrow against the cash value
Can withdraw from the cash value in a tax-advantaged way
Permanent life insurance
Policyholders of permanent life insurance have the ability to borrow against the accumulated value, which comes from regular premium payments along with interest and dividends credited to the policy.
Those looking to build a nest egg over a time horizon of several decades may want to consider cash value life insurance as a savings option, alongside a retirement plan like an IRA or 401(k). Be aware that cash values often don't begin accruing until two to five years have passed.
Yes, cash value policy premiums are typically higher than regular life insurance, because part of your payment goes toward savings.
If you make a withdrawal from the cash value in a life insurance policy, the death benefit will decrease. If you withdraw everything, the policy terminates. Withdrawing money from life insurance is tax-advantaged in that the IRS considered your withdrawals a return of the premiums you paid for the policy. So you can withdraw that amount of money without paying taxes. Any gains from dividends, however, would be taxed - but these would not occur until you've withdrawn all your premium payments.

Michael Jordan and Wilt Chamberlain are the two highest-scoring NBA players of all time. Before MJ retired, Wilt held the record for highest points per game average.
Jordan averaged over 31 points per game during his 13 seasons with the Bulls, which would have been a comfortable lead in that stat. However, in his comeback with the Wizards, his career scoring average dipped a few notches.

Jordan was still much, much better at scoring than Wilt – his postseason average bears that out. While Wilt’s average falls sharply to 22+ points per game, MJ’s average shoots up to 33.4 ppg. This is clear proof of Jordan elevating his game and Wilt being the Harden of his era – so to speak.
MJ holds the career scoring average record against the following franchises – Blazers, Jazz, Suns, Celtics, Hornets, Cavaliers, Rockets, Heat, Nets, Pacers, Hawks, Magic, Nuggets, Timberwolves, Bucks, Spurs.
Of these teams, the Bucks and Celtics already existed as teams when Wilt was playing. This means MJ averaged more points than Wilt Chamberlain despite the latter having up to 30% more possessions on a per-game basis.
Wilt Chamberlain holds this record against 6 teams – Lakers, Sixers, Knicks, Wizards (then the Bullets), Pistons (then in Fort Wayne) and the Kings (then the Cincinnati Royals).

[1] The original Egyptian name for the text, transliterated r(ꜣ)w n(y)w prt m hrw(w) , [2] is translated as Book of Coming Forth by Day [3] or Book of Emerging Forth into the Light . [ citation needed ] ""Book"" is the closest term to describe the loose collection of texts [4] consisting of a number of magic spells intended to assist a dead person's journey through the Duat , or underworld, and into the afterlife and written by many priests over a period of about 1,000 years. Karl Richard Lepsius introduced for these texts the German name Todtenbuch (modern spelling Totenbuch ), translated to English as Book of the Dead.
The Book of the Dead , which was placed in the coffin or burial chamber of the deceased, was part of a tradition of funerary texts which includes the earlier Pyramid Texts and Coffin Texts , which were painted onto objects, not written on papyrus. Some of the spells included in the book were drawn from these older works and date to the 3rd millennium BCE. Other spells were composed later in Egyptian history, dating to the Third Intermediate Period (11th to 7th centuries BCE). A number of the spells which make up the Book continued to be separately inscribed on tomb walls and sarcophagi , as the spells from which they originated always had been.
There was no single or canonical Book of the Dead . The surviving papyri contain a varying selection of religious and magical texts and vary considerably in their illustration. Some people seem to have commissioned their own copies of the Book of the Dead , perhaps choosing the spells they thought most vital in their own progression to the afterlife. The Book of the Dead was most commonly written in hieroglyphic or hieratic script on a papyrus scroll, and often illustrated with vignettes depicting the deceased and their journey into the afterlife.
The finest extant example of the Egyptian Book of the Dead in antiquity is the Papyrus of Ani . Ani was an Egyptian scribe. It was discovered by Sir E. A. Wallis Budge in 1888 and was taken to the British Museum , where it currently resides.
The Book of the Dead developed from a tradition of funerary manuscripts dating back to the Egyptian Old Kingdom . The first funerary texts were the Pyramid Texts , first used in the Pyramid of King Unas of the 5th Dynasty , around 2400 BCE. [5] These texts were written on the walls of the burial chambers within pyramids, and were exclusively for the use of the pharaoh (and, from the 6th Dynasty , the queen). The Pyramid Texts were written in an unusual hieroglyphic style; many of the hieroglyphs representing humans or animals were left incomplete or drawn mutilated, most likely to prevent them causing any harm to the dead pharaoh. [6] The purpose of the Pyramid Texts was to help the dead king take his place amongst the gods , in particular to reunite him with his divine father Ra ; at this period the afterlife was seen as being in the sky, rather than the underworld described in the Book of the Dead . [6] Towards the end of the Old Kingdom, the Pyramid Texts ceased to be an exclusively royal privilege, and were adopted by regional governors and other high-ranking officials. [6]
In the Middle Kingdom , a new funerary text emerged, the Coffin Texts . The Coffin Texts used a newer version of the language, new spells, and included illustrations for the first time. The Coffin Texts were most commonly written on the inner surfaces of coffins, though they are occasionally found on tomb walls or on papyri. [6] The Coffin Texts were available to wealthy private individuals, vastly increasing the number of people who could expect to participate in the afterlife; a process which has been described as the ""democratization of the afterlife"". [7]
The Book of the Dead first developed in Thebes toward the beginning of the Second Intermediate Period , around 1700 BCE. The earliest known occurrence of the spells included in the Book of the Dead is from the coffin of Queen Mentuhotep , of the 16th Dynasty , where the new spells were included amongst older texts known from the Pyramid Texts and Coffin Texts. Some of the spells introduced at this time claim an older provenance; for instance the rubric to spell 30B states that it was discovered by the Prince Hordjedef in the reign of King Menkaure , many hundreds of years before it is attested in the archaeological record. [8]
By the 17th Dynasty , the Book of the Dead had become widespread not only for members of the royal family, but courtiers and other officials as well. At this stage, the spells were typically inscribed on linen shrouds wrapped around the dead, though occasionally they are found written on coffins or on papyrus. [9]
The New Kingdom saw the Book of the Dead develop and spread further. The famous Spell 125, the ' Weighing of the Heart ', is first known from the reign of Hatshepsut and Thutmose III , c. 1475 BCE . From this period onward the Book of the Dead was typically written on a papyrus scroll, and the text illustrated with vignettes . During the 19th Dynasty in particular, the vignettes tended to be lavish, sometimes at the expense of the surrounding text. [10]
In the Third Intermediate Period , the Book of the Dead started to appear in hieratic script, as well as in the traditional hieroglyphics. The hieratic scrolls were a cheaper version, lacking illustration apart from a single vignette at the beginning, and were produced on smaller papyri. At the same time, many burials used additional funerary texts, for instance the Amduat . [11]
During the 25th and 26th Dynasties , the Book of the Dead was updated, revised and standardised. Spells were ordered and numbered consistently for the first time. This standardised version is known today as the 'Saite recension', after the Saite (26th) Dynasty. In the Late period and Ptolemaic period , the Book of the Dead continued to be based on the Saite recension, though increasingly abbreviated towards the end of the Ptolemaic period. New funerary texts appeared, including the Book of Breathing and Book of Traversing Eternity . The last use of the Book of the Dead was in the 1st century BCE, though some artistic motifs drawn from it were still in use in Roman times. [12]
The Book of the Dead is made up of a number of individual texts and their accompanying illustrations. Most sub-texts begin with the word r(ꜣ) , which can mean ""mouth"", ""speech"", ""spell"", ""utterance"", ""incantation"", or ""chapter of a book"". This ambiguity reflects the similarity in Egyptian thought between ritual speech and magical power. [14] In the context of the Book of the Dead , it is typically translated as either chapter or spell . In this article, the word spell is used.
At present, some 192 spells are known, [15] though no single manuscript contains them all. They served a range of purposes. Some are intended to give the deceased mystical knowledge in the afterlife, or perhaps to identify them with the gods: for instance, Spell 17 is an obscure and lengthy description of the god Atum . [16] Others are incantations to ensure the different elements of the dead person's being were preserved and reunited, and to give the deceased control over the world around him. Still others protect the deceased from various hostile forces or guide him through the underworld past various obstacles. Famously, two spells also deal with the judgment of the deceased in the Weighing of the Heart ritual.
Such spells as 26–30, and sometimes spells 6 and 126, relate to the heart and were inscribed on scarabs. [17]
The texts and images of the Book of the Dead were magical as well as religious. Magic was as legitimate an activity as praying to the gods, even when the magic was aimed at controlling the gods themselves. [18] Indeed, there was little distinction for the Ancient Egyptians between magical and religious practice. [19] The concept of magic ( heka ) was also intimately linked with the spoken and written word. The act of speaking a ritual formula was an act of creation; [20] there is a sense in which action and speech were one and the same thing. [19] The magical power of words extended to the written word. Hieroglyphic script was held to have been invented by the god Thoth , and the hieroglyphs themselves were powerful. Written words conveyed the full force of a spell. [20] This was even true when the text was abbreviated or omitted, as often occurred in later Book of the Dead scrolls, particularly if the accompanying images were present. [21] The Egyptians also believed that knowing the name of something gave power over it; thus, the Book of the Dead equips its owner with the mystical names of many of the entities he would encounter in the afterlife, giving him power over them. [22]
The spells of the Book of the Dead made use of several magical techniques which can also be seen in other areas of Egyptian life. A number of spells are for magical amulets , which would protect the deceased from harm. In addition to being represented on a Book of the Dead papyrus, these spells appeared on amulets wound into the wrappings of a mummy. [18] Everyday magic made use of amulets in huge numbers. Other items in direct contact with the body in the tomb, such as headrests, were also considered to have amuletic value. [23] A number of spells also refer to Egyptian beliefs about the magical healing power of saliva. [18]
Almost every Book of the Dead was unique, containing a different mixture of spells drawn from the corpus of texts available. For most of the history of the Book of the Dead there was no defined order or structure. [24] In fact, until Paul Barguet's 1967 ""pioneering study"" of common themes between texts, [25] Egyptologists concluded there was no internal structure at all. [26] It is only from the Saite period ( 26th Dynasty ) onwards that there is a defined order. [27]
The Books of the Dead from the Saite period tend to organize the Chapters into four sections:
- Chapters 1–16 : The deceased enters the tomb and descends to the underworld, and the body regains its powers of movement and speech.
- Chapters 17–63 : Explanation of the mythic origin of the gods and places. The deceased is made to live again so that he may arise, reborn, with the morning sun.
- Chapters 64–129 : The deceased travels across the sky in the sun barque as one of the blessed dead. In the evening, the deceased travels to the underworld to appear before Osiris.
- Chapters 130–189 : Having been vindicated, the deceased assumes power in the universe as one of the gods. This section also includes assorted chapters on protective amulets, provision of food, and important places. [26]
The spells in the Book of the Dead depict Egyptian beliefs about the nature of death and the afterlife. The Book of the Dead is a vital source of information about Egyptian beliefs in this area.
One aspect of death was the disintegration of the various kheperu , or modes of existence. [28] Funerary rituals served to re-integrate these different aspects of being. Mummification served to preserve and transform the physical body into sah , an idealised form with divine aspects; [29] the Book of the Dead contained spells aimed at preserving the body of the deceased, which may have been recited during the process of mummification. [30] The heart, which was regarded as the aspect of being which included intelligence and memory, was also protected with spells, and in case anything happened to the physical heart, it was common to bury jewelled heart scarabs with a body to provide a replacement. The ka , or life-force, remained in the tomb with the dead body, and required sustenance from offerings of food, water and incense. In case priests or relatives failed to provide these offerings, Spell 105 ensured the ka was satisfied. [31] The name of the dead person, which constituted their individuality and was required for their continued existence, was written in many places throughout the Book , and spell 25 ensured the deceased would remember their own name. [32] The ba was a free-ranging spirit aspect of the deceased. It was the ba , depicted as a human-headed bird, which could ""go forth by day"" from the tomb into the world; spells 61 and 89 acted to preserve it. [33] Finally, the shut , or shadow of the deceased, was preserved by spells 91, 92 and 188. [34] If all these aspects of the person could be variously preserved, remembered, and satiated, then the dead person would live on in the form of an akh . An akh was a blessed spirit with magical powers who would dwell among the gods. [35]
The nature of the afterlife which the dead people enjoyed is difficult to define, because of the differing traditions within Ancient Egyptian religion. In the Book of the Dead , the dead were taken into the presence of the god Osiris , who was confined to the subterranean Duat . There are also spells to enable the ba or akh of the dead to join Ra as he travelled the sky in his sun-barque, and help him fight off Apep . [36] As well as joining the Gods, the Book of the Dead also depicts the dead living on in the ' Field of Reeds ', a paradisiac likeness of the real world. [37] The Field of Reeds is depicted as a lush, plentiful version of the Egyptian way of living. There are fields, crops, oxen, people and waterways. The deceased person is shown encountering the Great Ennead , a group of gods, as well as his or her own parents. While the depiction of the Field of Reeds is pleasant and plentiful, it is also clear that manual labour is required. For this reason burials included a number of statuettes named shabti , or later ushebti . These statuettes were inscribed with a spell, also included in the Book of the Dead , requiring them to undertake any manual labour that might be the owner's duty in the afterlife. [38] It is also clear that the dead not only went to a place where the gods lived, but that they acquired divine characteristics themselves. In many occasions, the deceased is mentioned as ""The Osiris – [ Name ]"" in the Book of the Dead .
The path to the afterlife as laid out in the Book of the Dead was a difficult one. The deceased was required to pass a series of gates, caverns and mounds guarded by supernatural creatures. [40] These terrifying entities were armed with enormous knives and are illustrated in grotesque forms, typically as human figures with the heads of animals or combinations of different ferocious beasts. Their names—for instance, ""He who lives on snakes"" or ""He who dances in blood""—are equally grotesque. These creatures had to be pacified by reciting the appropriate spells included in the Book of the Dead ; once pacified they posed no further threat, and could even extend their protection to the dead person. [41] Another breed of supernatural creatures was 'slaughterers' who killed the unrighteous on behalf of Osiris; the Book of the Dead equipped its owner to escape their attentions. [42] As well as these supernatural entities, there were also threats from natural or supernatural animals, including crocodiles, snakes, and beetles. [43]
The deceased's first task was to correctly address each of the forty-two Assessors of Maat by name, while reciting the sins they did not commit during their lifetime. [44] This process allowed the dead to demonstrate that they knew each of the judges’ names or Ren and established that they were pure, and free of sin.
If all the obstacles of the Duat could be negotiated, the deceased would be judged in the "" Weighing of the Heart "" ritual, depicted in Spell 125. The deceased was led by the god Anubis into the presence of Osiris. There, the dead person swore that he had not committed any sin from a list of 42 sins , [45] reciting a text known as the ""Negative Confession"". Then the dead person's heart was weighed on a pair of scales, against the goddess Maat , who embodied truth and justice. Maat was often represented by an ostrich feather, the hieroglyphic sign for her name. [46] At this point, there was a risk that the deceased's heart would bear witness, owning up to sins committed in life; Spell 30B guarded against this eventuality. If the scales balanced, this meant the deceased had led a good life. Anubis would take them to Osiris and they would find their place in the afterlife, becoming maa-kheru , meaning ""vindicated"" or ""true of voice"". [47] If the heart was out of balance with Maat, then another fearsome beast called Ammit , the Devourer, stood ready to eat it and put the dead person's afterlife to an early and rather unpleasant end. [48]
This scene is remarkable not only for its vividness but as one of the few parts of the Book of the Dead with any explicit moral content. The judgment of the dead and the Negative Confession were a representation of the conventional moral code which governed Egyptian society. For every ""I have not..."" in the Negative Confession, it is possible to read an unexpressed ""Thou shalt not"". [49] While the Ten Commandments of Jewish and Christian ethics are rules of conduct laid down by a perceived divine revelation, the Negative Confession is more a divine enforcement of everyday morality. [50] Views differ among Egyptologists about how far the Negative Confession represents a moral absolute, with ethical purity being necessary for progress to the Afterlife. John Taylor points out the wording of Spells 30B and 125 suggests a pragmatic approach to morality; by preventing the heart from contradicting him with any inconvenient truths, it seems that the deceased could enter the afterlife even if their life had not been entirely pure. [48] Ogden Goelet says ""without an exemplary and moral existence, there was no hope for a successful afterlife"", [49] while Geraldine Pinch suggests that the Negative Confession is essentially similar to the spells protecting from demons, and that the success of the Weighing of the Heart depended on the mystical knowledge of the true names of the judges rather than on the deceased's moral behaviour. [51]
A Book of the Dead was produced to order by scribes. They were commissioned by people in preparation for their own funerals, or by the relatives of someone recently deceased. They were expensive items; one source gives the price of a Book of the Dead scroll as one deben of silver, [52] perhaps half the annual pay of a labourer. [53] Papyrus itself was evidently costly, as there are many instances of its re-use in everyday documents, creating palimpsests . In one case, a Book of the Dead was written on second-hand papyrus. [54]
Most owners of the Book of the Dead were evidently part of the social elite; they were initially reserved for the royal family, but later papyri are found in the tombs of scribes, priests and officials. Most owners were men, and generally the vignettes included the owner's wife as well. Towards the beginning of the history of the Book of the Dead , there are roughly ten copies belonging to men for every one for a woman. However, during the Third Intermediate Period, two were for women for every one for a man; and women owned roughly a third of the hieratic papyri from the Late and Ptolemaic Periods. [55]
The dimensions of a Book of the Dead could vary widely; the longest is 40 m long while some are as short as 1 m. They are composed of sheets of papyrus joined together, the individual papyri varying in width from 15 cm to 45 cm. The scribes working on Book of the Dead papyri took more care over their work than those working on more mundane texts; care was taken to frame the text within margins, and to avoid writing on the joints between sheets. The words peret em heru , or coming forth by day sometimes appear on the reverse of the outer margin, perhaps acting as a label. [54]
Books were often prefabricated in funerary workshops, with spaces being left for the name of the deceased to be written in later. [56] For instance, in the Papyrus of Ani , the name ""Ani"" appears at the top or bottom of a column, or immediately following a rubric introducing him as the speaker of a block of text; the name appears in a different handwriting to the rest of the manuscript, and in some places is mis-spelt or omitted entirely. [53]
The text of a New Kingdom Book of the Dead was typically written in cursive hieroglyphs , most often from left to right, but also sometimes from right to left. The hieroglyphs were in columns, which were separated by black lines – a similar arrangement to that used when hieroglyphs were carved on tomb walls or monuments. Illustrations were put in frames above, below, or between the columns of text. The largest illustrations took up a full page of papyrus. [57]
From the 21st Dynasty onward, more copies of the Book of the Dead are found in hieratic script. The calligraphy is similar to that of other hieratic manuscripts of the New Kingdom; the text is written in horizontal lines across wide columns (often the column size corresponds to the size of the papyrus sheets of which a scroll is made up). Occasionally a hieratic Book of the Dead contains captions in hieroglyphic.
The text of a Book of the Dead was written in both black and red ink, regardless of whether it was in hieroglyphic or hieratic script. Most of the text was in black, with red ink used for the titles of spells, opening and closing sections of spells, the instructions to perform spells correctly in rituals, and also for the names of dangerous creatures such as the demon Apep . [58] The black ink used was based on carbon , and the red ink on ochre , in both cases mixed with water. [59]
The style and nature of the vignettes used to illustrate a Book of the Dead varies widely. Some contain lavish colour illustrations, even making use of gold leaf . Others contain only line drawings, or one simple illustration at the opening. [60]
Book of the Dead papyri were often the work of several different scribes and artists whose work was literally pasted together. [54] It is usually possible to identify the style of more than one scribe used on a given manuscript, even when the manuscript is a shorter one. [58] The text and illustrations were produced by different scribes; there are a number of Books where the text was completed but the illustrations were left empty. [61]
The existence of the Book of the Dead was known as early as the Middle Ages , well before its contents could be understood. Since it was found in tombs, it was evidently a document of a religious nature, and this led to the widespread but mistaken belief that the Book of the Dead was the equivalent of a Bible or Qur'an . [62] [63]
In 1842 Karl Richard Lepsius published a translation of a manuscript dated to the Ptolemaic era and coined the name "" Book of The Dead"" ( das Todtenbuch ). He also introduced the spell numbering system which is still in use, identifying 165 different spells. [15] Lepsius promoted the idea of a comparative edition of the Book of the Dead , drawing on all relevant manuscripts. This project was undertaken by Édouard Naville , starting in 1875 and completed in 1886, producing a three-volume work including a selection of vignettes for every one of the 186 spells he worked with, the more significant variations of the text for every spell, and commentary. In 1867 Samuel Birch of the British Museum published the first extensive English translation. [64] In 1876 he published a photographic copy of the Papyrus of Nebseny. [65]
The work of E. A. Wallis Budge , Birch's successor at the British Museum, is still in wide circulation – including both his hieroglyphic editions and his English translations of the Papyrus of Ani , though the latter are now considered inaccurate and out-of-date. [66] More recent translations in English have been published by T. G. Allen (1974) and Raymond O. Faulkner (1972). [67] As more work has been done on the Book of the Dead , more spells have been identified, and the total now stands at 192. [15]
In the 1970s, Ursula Rößler-Köhler at the University of Bonn began a working group to develop the history of Book of the Dead texts. This later received sponsorship from the German state of North Rhine-Westphalia and the German Research Foundation, in 2004 coming under the auspices of the German Academies of Sciences and Arts. Today the Book of the Dead Project, as it is called, maintains a database of documentation and photography covering 80% of extant copies and fragments from the corpus of Book of the Dead texts, and provides current services to Egyptologists. [68] It is housed at the University of Bonn, with much material available online. [69] Affiliated scholars are authoring a series of monograph studies, the Studien zum Altägyptischen Totenbuch , alongside a series that publishes the manuscripts themselves, Handschriften des Altägyptischen Totenbuches . [70] Both are in print by Harrassowitz Verlag. Orientverlag has released another series of related monographs, Totenbuchtexte , focused on analysis, synoptic comparison, and textual criticism.
Research work on the Book of the Dead has always posed technical difficulties thanks to the need to copy very long hieroglyphic texts. Initially, these were copied out by hand, with the assistance either of tracing paper or a camera lucida . In the mid-19th century, hieroglyphic fonts became available and made lithographic reproduction of manuscripts more feasible. In the present day, hieroglyphics can be rendered in desktop publishing software and this, combined with digital print technology, means that the costs of publishing a Book of the Dead may be considerably reduced. However, a very large amount of the source material in museums around the world remains unpublished. [71]
In 2023, the Ministry of Antiquities announced the finding of sections of the Book of the Dead on a 16-foot papyrus in a coffin near the Step Pyramid of Djoser . [72]
- c. 3150 BCE – First preserved hieroglyphs, on small labels in the tomb of a king buried (in tomb U-j) at Abydos
- c. 3000 BCE – The beginning of the numbered dynasties of kings of ancient Egypt
- c. 2345 BCE – First royal pyramid, of King Unas, to contain the Pyramid Texts , carved precursors (intended only for the king) to the funerary literature from which the Book of the Dead ultimately developed
- c. 2100 BCE – First Coffin Texts , developed from the Pyramid Texts and for a time painted on the coffins of commoners. Many spells of the Book of the Dead are closely derived from them
- c. 1600 BCE – Earliest spells of the Book of the Dead , on the coffin of Queen Menthuhotep , an ancestor of kings from the New Kingdom
- c. 1550 BCE – From this time onward to the beginning of the New Kingdom, papyrus copies of the Book of the Dead are used instead of inscribing spells on the walls of the tombs
- c. 600 BCE – Approximately when the order of the spells became standard
- 42–553 CE – Christianity spreads to Egypt, gradually replacing the native religion as successive emperors alternately tolerate or suppress them, culminating in the last temple at Philae (also site of the last known religious inscription in demotic, dating from 452) being closed by order of Emperor Justinian in 533
- 2nd century CE – Possibly the last copies of the Book of the Dead were produced, but it is a poorly documented era of history
- 1798 CE – Napoleon's invasion of Egypt encourages European interests in ancient Egypt; 1799, Vivant Denon was handed a copy of the Book of the Dead
- 1805 CE – Jean-Marcel Cadet makes the first publication, on 18 plates, of a Book of the Dead , Copie figurée d'un rouleau de papyrus trouvé à Thèbes, dans un tombeau des rois [73]
- 1822 CE – Jean-François Champollion announces the key to the decipherment of ancient Egyptian hieroglyphic writing, subsequently developed in his later publications, the most extensive after his death in 1832
- 1842 CE – Lepsius publishes the first major study of the Book of the Dead , begins the numbering of the spells or chapters, and brings the name ""Book of the Dead"" into general circulation [74]

Other regions that are critical for self-awareness include the insular cortex and the anterior cingulate cortex.,The medial prefrontal cortex is a brain region related to self-thought and self-esteem.,"Researchers at Dartmouth College have identified a region of the human brain that seems to predict a person's self-esteem levels.
It's called the frontostriatal pathway, and the stronger and more active it is in the brain, the more self-esteem someone has. The findings, published online in the journal Social Cognitive and Affective Neuroscience, could help change the way we understand self-esteem: not as a panacea for all problems, but as a physical indicator of risk for psychological disorders.
""People think raising self-esteem will raise IQs and test scores, and that hasn't really panned out,"" said lead author Robert Chavez, a Ph.D. student at Dartmouth. ""We should be looking at it more as a measure of how susceptible you are to psychopathologies like depression and anxiety.""
Chavez found that self-esteem lies in the frontostriatal pathway, highlighted in the illustration below:
A depiction of the anatomical connections between the ventral striatum and the prefrontal cortex. The strength of these connections correlated with subjects' self-esteem scores in the study. (Courtesy of Robert Chavez)
It connects the medial prefrontal cortex, which deals with self-knowledge, to the ventral striatum, which deals with feelings of motivation and reward. Chavez used two different kinds of magnetic resonance imaging to measure both the physical boundaries of the pathway -- what he called the ""road"" -- and activity levels on that pathway -- or the ""traffic"" on that road.
If a person had a very strong ""road,"" he or she was more likely to have higher long-term self-esteem. The ""traffic"" levels on that road, however, predicted higher momentary self-esteem.
Sometimes a person's frontostriatal pathway would be both anatomically strong and very active, but one quality didn't necessarily lead to the other.
For the study, Chavez and Todd Heatherton, Ph.D., a Dartmouth professor, teamed up to scan 48 people's brains using both diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). While the scans were taking place, participants answered questions about how they saw themselves in the moment and long-term by rating themselves on qualities like ""hard-working,"" ""happy,"" ""depressed"" and ""pessimistic."" The terms were equally split between positive and negative descriptions.
Then Chavez analyzed participants' brain scans and matched them up to the times they rated themselves based on certain traits. He saw that when participants answered about self-esteem in the short term, the scan showed a lot of activity on the pathway. Meanwhile, the stronger the pathway was anatomically, the more likely participants were to have long-term self-esteem. Interestingly, Chavez only saw brain activity on the scans when people rated themselves with positive terms, not negative ones.
""Being down on yourself doesn't drive these effects,"" explained Chavez. ""It's more driven by the positive aspects of your sense of self.""
Given past studies about how repeated behaviors (say, meditation ) can actually alter brain traits, Chavez is hopeful that researchers can figure out a way to change or strengthen the frontostriatal pathway with therapy -- and use MRIs to monitor a patient's progress.",source_text/9c1562312b249a6f6d55492fb8b94f4f2985c0ff58884d9a5852dcb09d9364bd-perplexity_0_2.txt,"It connects the medial prefrontal cortex, which deals with self-knowledge, to the ventral striatum, which deals with feelings of motivation and reward.",partial_support,True,bones - lobe - melanin - phalanges - tendon - cortex - brain - skeleton - bone - iris,StanfordCitation,0.55,0.5466666666666667,0.55,0.54,[0.8968513607978821],[0.8968513607978821]

A significant obstacle to the realization of the free and equal status of all citizens within democratic societies is the inheritance of wealth -- or more precisely, the intergenerational accumulation and transfer of wealth within families. The extreme wealth inequality caused by flows of inheritances can render a de jure democratic society a de facto aristocracy, wherein individuals' life-prospects are determined largely by the economic class into which they are born. Because of this, liberal egalitarian justice demands limits on inheritances. John Rawls, for instance, recommends that intergenerational bequeathments and gifts be taxed, so that individuals can acquire only limited amounts of wealth through such processes over the courses of their lifetimes. [1]
Rawls's treatment of inheritance is quite brief, and there has been little discussion of the topic by other egalitarian philosophers over the two decades since the publication of Justice as Fairness: A Restatement . This is surprising, given our ""new Gilded Age"" of extreme wealth inequality. [2] Thankfully, Daniel Halliday's excellent book helps to fill this lacuna. Of special philosophical interest is Halliday's attempt to integrate elements of ""luck egalitarianism"" within a ""social egalitarian"" framework. This endeavour is both misguided and unnecessary -- or so I shall suggest below. I nonetheless recommend this book enthusiastically to anyone interested in questions of distributive justice. Hopefully it will prompt further examination and debate of this important topic.
I.
The first chapter of Halliday's book provides an overview of its main themes and theses. A primary concern is ""economic segregation."" In an economically segregated society: (a) individuals belong to groups that are distinguished by different levels of wealth (say, the ""top 1%"" versus the ""next 19%"" versus the next four quintiles); (b) there is little movement by individuals between groups during their lives; and (c) members of different groups enjoy different levels of opportunities (educational, professional, etc.) and political power. Liberal egalitarian justice requires the elimination, insofar as it is feasible, of entrenched class hierarchy. The arbitrary inequalities among citizens based on the economic groups into which they are born violates liberal justice in much the same way as group-based inequalities based upon race, sex, sexual orientation, and religion.
The book also aims to integrate two rival views of egalitarian justice. Halliday's liberal egalitarian framework is novel in that it is a social egalitarian one that purports to incorporate certain core luck egalitarian ideas. He claims that ""neither approach works especially well if used alone but that they work well when combined in the right way"" (p .5). (As I explain later, I do not think that this integrative project is successful; however, I also do not think it is necessary for Halliday's other main positions.)
A third key claim of the book is that liberal egalitarianism can best address the problem of inherited wealth via what Halliday refers to as the ""Rignano scheme"" (this scheme is drawn from the early twentieth-century work of the Italian theorist Eugenio Rignano). According to the Rignano scheme, ""inheritance can be taxed at a greater rate when it rolls over -- when it gets passed down more than once"" (p. 7). What this means, roughly, is that if Albert creates 100 dollars of wealth during his lifetime, he should be able to bequeath most of that to his daughter Beth. However, if Beth retains most of that wealth, say 80 dollars, much of that (perhaps all) should be taxed away if she bequeaths it to her son Cassius (so Cassius would receive little or nothing in second-generation inheritance). The low tax rate imposed on only the initial transfer has two justifications. First, it gives Albert an incentive to work hard (so that he can pass on some wealth to Beth), but it also creates an incentive for Beth to avoid idleness (since she must create new wealth if she wishes to bequeath any to Cassius). Second, the Rignano scheme may encourage the development and dispersal of new wealth throughout the population, thereby fostering the growth of the middle-class (bequeathments of ""old money,"" in contrast, have no similar positive effects, and hence can be taxed away).
Chapter two discusses the views of early liberal writers on inheritance. The positions of John Locke, Adam Smith, Thomas Paine, William Godwin, and John Stuart Mill are outlined and evaluated. Chapter three focuses on Mill's utilitarianism and the Rignano scheme, as formulated primarily in Rignano's The Social Significance of Death Duties . Halliday explains that Rignano was working within Mill's utilitarian framework, and recommends that we repurpose the Rignano scheme for liberal egalitarianism. Liberal egalitarianism is concerned with securing and maintaining the free and equal standing of all citizens over time. This requires preventing or breaking up economic segregation, and the Rignano scheme can help do this.
Halliday develops his egalitarian framework in chapters three, four, and five. Since my main criticism of the book concerns his attempt to integrate elements of luck egalitarianism into a social egalitarian framework, I will save my discussion of these chapters until the next section.
Chapter seven addresses libertarian views. It is not clear to me why this chapter is included in the book. Halliday writes that ""there is more to be gained from using libertarian insights to develop the views that I have already defended, rather than being drawn into the broader fight between egalitarians and libertarians"" (p. 162). But since libertarianism is incompatible with liberal egalitarianism, including Halliday's version, I cannot see what utility these ""insights"" might have. I would have welcomed some explanation of how liberal egalitarianism might perhaps revise and appropriate them.
The final chapter is the most ""applied"" of the book as it considers alternative tax schemes and argues that the Rignano scheme is to be preferred over viable alternatives for addressing the problem of economic segregation. Halliday emphasizes that a just tax scheme must satisfy a (Rawlsian) criterion of publicity, and that alternative schemes must be evaluated against each other rather than against some perfect ideal, with the recognition that any scheme when implemented will be imperfect (pp. 186-88).
I found especially interesting Halliday's comparison of his proposal with Thomas Piketty's endorsement of a wealth tax (pp. 201-204). The two proposals have different targets: Piketty's wealth tax concerns the staggering wealth of a small class of elite rentiers, whereas the Rignano scheme addresses more general economic segregation. Halliday concludes that the two proposals consequently are compatible. This is an interesting claim, I think, and worthy of further consideration.
II.
As mentioned earlier, in chapters three, four, and five, Halliday tries to formulate a version of liberal egalitarianism that integrates luck egalitarianism and social egalitarianism. I think that this integrative endeavour is unsuccessful.
First, some background. Two families of liberal egalitarian conceptions of justice have emerged over the past few decades: luck egalitarianism and social egalitarianism (the latter also is known as ""relational egalitarianism""). Both families share a common ancestor: the account of justice presented in Rawls's A Theory of Justice . Luck egalitarians have understood their project, at least in part, as developing the implications of Rawls's comments on the ""moral arbitrariness"" of the distribution of unchosen social and natural advantages in Theory [3] into a distinct approach to theorizing about justice, one that is egalitarian in nature but also sensitive to individual responsibility. According to luck egalitarians, the aim of justice is to neutralize any disadvantages that people are born into or acquire as the result of brute luck, disadvantages for which they are not responsible and consequently do not deserve. In a fully just luck egalitarian society, people would fare well or poorly solely in conformity to those decisions and actions for which they are rightly responsible.
But despite helping to inspire luck egalitarianism, Rawls's own conception of ""justice as fairness"" is a form of social egalitarianism. While not all social egalitarians endorse justice as fairness, they generally follow Rawls's ""constructivist"" approach to thinking about justice. [4] According to this approach, broadly speaking, principles of political justice should be understood as rationally constructed in order to satisfy the requirements of reciprocity among free and equal citizens under conditions of relative scarcity. A fully just social egalitarian society, then, is not one that ""neutralizes luck,"" but rather one in which citizens relate to each other as social equals on the basis of mutual respect, and freely govern their lives on conditions fair to all.
Halliday's view is primarily a social egalitarian one. He explains some of the key problems with luck egalitarianism, especially as applied to questions having to do with inheritance, in chapter four. For instance, because of its single-minded focus on the distinction between ""choice"" and ""circumstance,"" what Halliday terms ""naïve luck egalitarianism"" implausibly condemns "" all inheritance no matter its size."" So naïve luck egalitarianism condemns as unjust the inheritance of ""my grandfather's old beer tankard"" (pp. 77-78). After dispatching naïve luck egalitarianism, the more nuanced views of theorists such as G.A. Cohen, Kok-Chor Tan, and Ronald Dworkin are discussed and criticized. Ultimately, Halliday holds that luck egalitarianism, by itself, is unsatisfactory because of its focus on whether or not individuals ""deserve"" their conditions and holdings: the view cannot address the problem of group segregation and inequality, including economic segregation.
Chapters five and six discuss economic segregation and how inheritance helps to maintain it over time. ""Economic segregation,"" Halliday writes, ""is a type of social segregation that occurs when groups have their boundaries defined by economic difference rather than by (e.g.) racial or religious difference"" (p. 102). Halliday points out that it is not just inequality of wealth that is a cause of social segregation. The intergenerational transfer of wealth facilitates the hoarding of non financial -- social and cultural -- capital. Social capital ""consists in valuable knowledge and opportunities,"" whereas cultural capital ""consists in certain behavioural norms or dispositions"" (p. 107). According to Halliday,
the significance of inheritance owes much to the way in which intergenerational transfers help groups maintain their accumulated nonfinancial capital, even if nonfinancial capital is not transferred down the generations simply as an automatic consequence of the transfer of wealth. (pp. 107-108)
Those who inherit wealth, or know that they will eventually, can devote considerable resources and time to providing their children with the means for superior life-prospects. Valuable cultural capital can be transferred through the cultivation of ""prestigious"" hobbies and skills (violin-playing or fluency in a foreign language), as well as education and more general patterns of behaviour (accents, confidence when interacting with authorities, and so forth). Social capital is secured via access to elite schools, internships, job opportunities, and the like. These forms of nonfinancial capital reinforce each other: those who possess cultural capital can exploit effectively their social capital. Moreover, these advantages reinforce themselves over generations: parents who already possess cultural and social capital can transfer it to their children more readily than those who do not. The discussion of these processes in chapters five and six -- and the difficulty, if not practical impossibility, of overcoming them without wealth redistribution, including restrictions on inheritances -- is insightful and important.
Halliday notes that social egalitarianism is committed to two core claims about justice, one ""negative"" and one ""positive."" The negative claim is that ""equality requires the elimination of oppressive social hierarchies."" The positive claim is that justice requires that social institutions be reformed or designed ""so as to create a genuine society of equals"" (p. 105). Inheritance flows facilitate economic segregation, and economic segregation is a social hierarchy that thwarts the creation of a society of substantively free and equal citizens. Consequently, the social egalitarian case for regulating inheritance, whether via the Rignano scheme or some other form of taxation, is straightforward. Citizens cannot relate to one another as equals if they live in a de facto aristocracy, that is, a society that (to a great extent) allocates economic opportunities and political power based upon citizens' unchosen classes.
The social egalitarian view looks sufficient to justify the regulation of intergenerational flows of wealth. Yet Halliday contends that luck egalitarianism also has a role to play: ""luck cannot be eliminated from an egalitarian diagnosis of what is objectionable about unrestricted inheritance,"" he writes, ""Inheritance is unjust when it allows some people to enjoy brute luck advantage, but the specific kind of brute luck advantage is understood in terms of group membership"" (p. 152). So, while social egalitarianism helps explain why economic segregation is unjust and measures should be taken to eliminate or reduce it as much as possible, including regulating inheritances, it needs to be supplemented with the claim that it is unjust that some people enjoy superior or inferior life prospects simply in virtue of having been born into one economic class or another.
I think that this attempt to integrate luck egalitarianism and social egalitarianism misconstrues the nature of social egalitarianism's objection to social segregation. Social egalitarians are aware that it is a matter of ""luck"" that, for instance, some people need wheelchairs to get around adequately and others do not. But this is not why justice requires the adequate provision of wheelchairs to all citizens who need them, and that public and commercial spaces must accommodate them. Such accommodation simply is necessary for equal citizenship -- ""correcting"" for brute bad luck has nothing to do with it.
When someone is born into a family in which there is considerable inherited wealth -- in which one's parents themselves inherited or will inherit wealth, and thus can secure competitive advantages with respect to social and cultural capital for the person in question -- this is indeed a matter of ""luck,"" insofar as that person did nothing to ""deserve"" that place within the social hierarchy. Likewise, someone born white and male in a racist and patriarchal society did nothing to ""deserve"" that privileged position. But it is not the luck in such cases that is the problem; rather it is the hierarchy . Social egalitarians aim at the elimination of economically segregated hierarchies altogether, whatever their source, because hierarchies prevent egalitarian social relations -- just as they aim at the elimination of race- or sex-based hierarchies. Consequently, I do not think that social egalitarianism ""needs"" to embed any luck egalitarian component into its framework -- ""anti-luckism"" simply is not a concern of social egalitarianism. (Being born poor, non-white, and/or female are not ""misfortunes"" for which one should be ""compensated."")
The Rawlsian version of social egalitarianism, for instance, holds that social equality involves ensuring that the principles of justice that are to regulate the most important social institutions of society, its ""basic structure,"" enable citizens to live and interact as both equal subjects and co-sovereigns. Hence those principles must satisfy what Rawls calls the ""criterion of reciprocity."" According to Halliday, ""reciprocity is not the only concept that Rawls used to derive the requirements of justice and . . . he did not actually invoke the concept of reciprocity when alluding to why justice might require restrictions on inherited wealth"" (p. 90). This is a misinterpretation, though, as it fails to recognize the foundational role of reciprocity in Rawls's theory. The criterion of reciprocity is the ""intrinsic (moral) political ideal"" of justice as fairness [5] -- indeed, it justifies the use of the ""original position"" device to formulate the principles of justice as fairness. [6] Consequently, reciprocity does justify Rawls's overall conception of justice and the restrictions on inherited wealth that he thinks are required by that conception. Justice as fairness is the most reasonable conception of justice because it best satisfies the requirements of reciprocity. [7]
Once we see that social egalitarianism (at least of the Rawlsian variety) is committed to reciprocity, and economic segregation violates the requirements of reciprocity (as expressed in the principles of justice), then the case for regulating the intergenerational transfer of wealth is straightforward -- as Rawls's own brief recommendations indicate. There is no need to appeal to any form of luck egalitarianism. Moreover, the social egalitarian case is not only sufficient, but its ""second personal"" constructivist character, focused on reciprocity, cannot felicitously be merged with the assumptions of luck egalitarianism. [8]
III.
My comments have focused primarily on the aspect of Halliday's view with which I disagree. Nonetheless, I think that the analyses and arguments presented in this book are interesting and important. I learned a lot from reading it. Halliday certainly is correct that justice requires the regulation of inheritances, and the Rignano scheme is an intriguing proposal for how to do so. Hence, I strongly recommend this book to anyone interested in contemporary issues concerning distributive justice.

Ryan Douglas Hurst [1] (born June 19, 1976) is an American actor, known for his roles as Gerry Bertier in Remember the Titans (2000), Sgt. Ernie Savage in We Were Soldiers (2002), Tom Clarke in Taken (2002), Opie Winston in the FX drama series Sons of Anarchy (2008–2012), Chick Hogan in Bates Motel (2015–2017), Li'l ""Foster"" Farrell in Outsiders (2016–2017), Beta in The Walking Dead (2019–2020), and Hector Bonner in Bosch (2019–2021). He portrayed the Norse god Thor in the 2022 video game God of War Ragnarök , for which he received a BAFTA Award nomination. [2]
Hurst was born in Santa Monica, California , the son of Candace Kaniecki, an acting coach, who currently runs the Candace Kaniecki (Herman) Acting School, and Rick Hurst , an actor best known for playing ""Deputy Cletus Hogg"" in the Dukes of Hazard . [3] He attended Santa Monica High School . [4] He converted to Sikhism and his Sikh name is Gobind Seva Singh. [5] [6]
Growing up in a Hollywood family, Hurst made a very early start in show business, with a recurring role in the NBC teen situation comedy series Saved by the Bell: The New Class . [7] In the 1998 epic war film Saving Private Ryan , Hurst portrayed Michaelson, a paratrooper who, despite a temporary hearing loss, is able to communicate to Captain John H. Miller ( Tom Hanks ) the approximate location of Private Ryan. In 2000, Hurst followed this with a role in Rules of Engagement and the central supporting role of Gerry Bertier in Remember the Titans . Additionally, he appeared in the war film We Were Soldiers (2002) as Sgt. Ernie Savage, played the football player Lump Hudson in the black comedy thriller film The Ladykillers (2004), and starred in the TNT police drama series Wanted (2005). From 2005 to 2007, Hurst gained recognition for portraying the recurring role of Allison DuBois ' half-brother, Michael Benoit, in NBC's supernatural procedural drama series Medium .
Hurst's big break came when he was cast as Opie Winston in the FX crime drama series Sons of Anarchy . Originally a recurring cast member in the first season , he was promoted to main cast member for the following season and went on to become a fan favorite. His character, newly released from a five-year prison stint and ""living right"", but not making ends meet, goes back to SAMCRO to provide for his family, despite his wife's objections and his knowing the risks. Hurst's portrayal of Opie earned him the Satellite Award for Best Supporting Actor – Series, Miniseries or Television Film in 2011. Also in 2011, Hurst voiced Jedidiah in the animated box office hit Rango . He also stars in the WGN America series Outsiders . In August 2018, it was announced that he would star as Beta on AMC 's The Walking Dead . [8] His debut episode, "" Guardians "", premiered on March 3, 2019. [9]
In 2022, Hurst voiced Thor in God of War: Ragnarök and also provided the motion-capture.
Hurst and Molly Cookson met in 1994 and married in May 2005. [10] [11] Together, they founded the production company Fast Shoes. [12] In April 2013, Hurst purchased a 3,400 square-foot home in Woodland Hills, California for $1.71 million. [13]

Each half of the brain is divided into four areas called Lobes .
The Frontal Lobes are located in the front of the brain. They are very large and have many functions. The frontal lobes are considered to be our emotional control centre. They play a central role in our personality and how we act. They are also involved in attention skills and controlling movement.
The frontal lobes manage skills known as Executive Functions . These are very important skills we use for things such as solving problems, planning, making decisions and controlling our behaviour. The frontal lobes work like the conductor of an orchestra who keeps all the musicians playing together harmoniously.
The frontal lobes are particularly vulnerable to injury because they are large and are at the front of the brain. An injury to the frontal lobes can lead to a number of changes including:
- Changes in personality.
- Difficulties with attention and taking in information.
- Emotional responses may be reduced.
- Difficulties with motivation (Apathy) or getting things started (Initiation).
- Changes in the ability to control behaviour (Disinhibition). This means that the person may be more impulsive. They may say or do things without considering the consequences.
- Reduced self-awareness (Anosagnosia).
- Poor judgment and decision-making.
- Difficulty planning things and meeting goals.
- ‘Black and white’ thinking (Concrete Thinking).
- Irritability and less tolerance of frustration.
The Temporal Lobes are located on the side of your brain just above your ears. One of their important functions is to help us process and understand sounds such as musical notes and speech. Other functions include managing our emotions and recognising faces. A part of the temporal lobe, called the Hippocampus , also plays an important role in memory.
- Difficulty in recognising faces, things or places.
- Difficulty understanding or remembering what people say.
- Difficulty reading.
- Difficulty recognising objects.
- Short-term memory difficulties.
- Changes in sexual behaviour.
- Increased aggression.
The Parietal Lobes are located behind the frontal lobes and above the temporal lobes. One of their main functions is to allow us to make sense of things we touch – for example, whether an object is smooth or sharp, firm or soft.
The parietal lobes also tell us where our body is in relation to the objects around us. This allows us to move around without bumping in to things. This function is known as Visuospatial Processing .
The parietal lobes are also important for skills such as maths, spelling, hand-eye coordination and fine motor movements such as tying shoe laces.
- Difficulty naming objects (Anomia).
- Difficulty in distinguishing left from right.
- Difficulties with hand-eye coordination.
- Difficulty making sense of what we see even if we do not have a visual impairment (Visual Perceptual difficulty).
- Difficulty knowing the function of an object.
- Problems with reading (Alexia), writing (Agraphia) or maths (Dyscalculia).
- Difficulty knowing where things are in relation to our own bodies; for example, how close an object is to us (Spatial Awareness Difficulties).
- Reduced self-awareness (Anosognosia).
- Visual Neglect.
The Occipital Lobes are located at the back of the brain. They have an important role in vision because they allow us to make sense of information that comes from our eyes. This process is known as Visual Perception.
- Sight defects
- Blurred vision or sight loss.
- Visual hallucinations and distortions.
- Difficulty with identifying colours
- Difficulty recognising words.
- Difficulty recognising when people, or things, are moving .",source_text/596617b9eac857ef689cd629f3425977a76dd0568c9fa80204fe348de60c1d80-perplexity_0_2.txt,Each half of the brain is divided into four areas called Lobes.,complete_support,False,bones - lobe - melanin - phalanges - tendon - cortex - brain - skeleton - bone - iris,StanfordCitation,0.51,0.48333333333333334,0.47,0.47,[0.6964353919029236],[0.6964353919029236]

Flowering Orchards is a series of paintings which Dutch artist Vincent van Gogh executed in Arles , in southern France in the spring of 1888. Van Gogh arrived in Arles in February 1888 in a snowstorm; within two weeks the weather changed and the fruit trees were in blossom. Appreciating the symbolism of rebirth, Van Gogh worked with optimism and zeal on about fourteen paintings of flowering trees in the early spring. He also made paintings of flowering trees in Saint-Rémy the following year, in 1889.
Flowering trees were special to Van Gogh; they represented awakening and hope. He enjoyed them aesthetically and found joy in painting flowering trees. The 'trees and orchards in bloom' paintings that he made reflect Impressionist , Divisionist and Japanese woodcut influences.
When Van Gogh arrived in Arles in February 1888, the area's fruit trees in the orchards were about to bloom. [1] The blossoms of the apricot, peach and plum trees motivated him, [2] and within a month he had created fourteen paintings of blossoming fruit trees. [3] Excited by the subject matter, he completed nearly one painting a day. [4] Around April 21 Van Gogh wrote to his brother Theo , that he ""will have to seek something new, now the orchards have almost finished blossoming."" [3]
Flowering trees represented a source of spiritual renewal for Van Gogh; in 1883 he had written of the symbolism of the flowering tree, seeing the evidence of rebirth like the ""man who finally produces something poignant as the blossom of a hard, difficult life, is a wonder, like the black hawthorn , or better still the gnarled old apple tree which at certain moments bears blossoms which are among the most delicate and virginal things under the sun."" [5]
In 1888 Van Gogh became inspired in southern France and began the most productive period of his painting career. He sought the brilliance and light of the sun which would obscure the detail, simplifying the subjects. It also would make the lines of composition clearer; which would suit his ambition to create the simple patterns that he appreciated in Japanese woodblocks . Arles , he said, was ""the Japan of the South."" Van Gogh found in the south that colors were more vivid. Pairs of complementary colors, such as ""the red and green of the plants, the woven highlights of oranges and blue in the fence, even the pink clouds that enliven the turquoise sky"" — create an intensity through their pairing. [6]
Mancoff says of flowering trees and this work, [7]
""In his flowering trees, Vincent attained a sense of spontaneity, freeing himself from the strict self-analytical approach he took in Paris. In Almond Tree in Blossom, Vincent used the light, broken strokes of impressionism and the dabs of colour of divisionism for a sparkling surface effect. The distinctive contours of the tree and its position in the foreground recall the formal qualities of Japanese prints.""
The southern region and the flowering trees seems to have awakened Van Gogh from his doldrums into a state of clear direction, hyper-activity and good cheer. He wrote, ""I am up to my ears in work for the trees are in blossom and I want to paint a Provençal orchard of astonishing gaiety."" While in the past a very active period would have drained him, this time he was invigorated. [8]
To paint the flowering orchards, Van Gogh contended with the winds which were so strong that he drove pegs into the ground to which he fastened his easel. Even so, he found painting the orchards ""too lovely"" to miss. [9]
Van Gogh may have envisioned several triptychs of his paintings of orchards and flowering trees. However, only one triptych grouping has been documented, one which Vincent envisioned and sketched for Theo's apartment. Johanna van Gogh-Bonger displayed them in the apartment according to Van Gogh's sketch, the vertical Pink Peach Tree between the Pink Orchard and the White Orchard . [10] [11] [12]
In Paris, Van Gogh had learned to paint more than what one sees, but what it should be. He felt Pink Orchard was an example of wise use of that technique, such as leaving a field blank behind the orchard to create the feeling of distance. The way in which he outlined the bark of the tree indicates influence of the Japanese prints that he greatly admired. Using an Impressionist technique of placing colors side by side, Van Gogh makes short dots or brush strokes of colors to represent grass. On the top of the tree he uses rougher, more impasto brushstrokes to represent the colorful blossoms. [12] Vincent asked Theo to ""shave off"" some of the impasto in this painting. Apparently he did not reline, a process of heavy pressure and heat to flatten the surface, because sharp edges of thick impasto remain on the canvas. [13]
In the Pink Peach Tree , center of the triptych, the bright pink in the painting has faded over time and looks more white than pink now. [12]
Van Gogh wrote of his approach, perhaps due to the challenges of painting in the mistral winds, and use of color in painting the flowering tree like the Pink Peach Tree :
""At the moment I am absorbed in the blooming fruit trees, pink peach trees, yellow-white pear trees. My brush stroke has no system at all. I hit the canvas with irregular touches of the brush, which I leave as they are. Patches of thickly laid-on color, spots of canvas left uncovered, here and there portions that are absolutely unfinished, repetitions, savageries… Working direct on the spot all the time, I try to grasp what is essential in the drawings -- later I fill in the spaces which are bounded by contours — either expressed or not, but in any case felt — with tones which are also simplified, by which I mean that all that is going to be soil will have the same violet-like tone, that the whole sky will have a blue tint, that the green vegetation will be either green-blue or green-yellow, purposefully exaggerating the yellows and blues in this case."" [14]
Continuing on with his paintings of orchards, Van Gogh wrote, ""At the moment I am working on some plum trees, yellowish-white, with thousands of black branches."" [15] Two days later he wrote of the same painting, ""This morning I worked on an orchard of plum trees in bloom; all at once a fierce wind sprang up, an effect I had seen nowhere else but here, and returned at intervals. The sun shone in between, and all the little white flowers sparkled. It was so lovely. My friend the Dane came to join me, and I went on painting at the risk and peril of seeing the whole show on the ground at any moment - it's a white effect with a good deal of yellow in it, and blue and lilac, the sky white and blue.""

Van Gogh chose Blossoming Pear Tree as the center piece of a grouping, [17] However, there is no information linking this painting to any others.
The Van Gogh Museum described Van Gogh's approach and technique when he made Blossoming Pear Tree :
He chose a high vantage point, creating a contrast between the angular trunk and branches with their dark, heavy contours and the light background. A stone wall and a few trees can be seen to the rear, while to the left is a fence in front of a garden near a pink-yellow house. The large, flat yellow butterfly among the flowers to the right of the trunk is also noteworthy. The decorative painting, with the small tree in the foreground, the high vantage point and the lack of depth, is strongly influenced by the art of the Japanese printmakers, which Van Gogh admired enormously. [18]
It is difficult to overstate the impact that Japanese art had on Van Gogh. In a letter to Theo, he said, ""All my work is in a way founded on Japanese art, and we do not know enough about Japanese prints. In decadence in its own country, pigeonholed in collections already impossible to find in Japan itself, Japanese art is taking root again among French Impressionist artists."" [19]",source_text/b08635bb16fd75edcd0f2f45f88826aa36cc9275cebb8f00dcc4171417a5c8af-bing_chat_0_0.txt,"""At the moment I am absorbed in the blooming fruit trees, pink peach trees, yellow-white pear trees.

The nodes in the tree represent the different elements of the code, such as statements and expressions, while the edges represent the relationships between these elements. The process of constructing an AST involves parsing the original source code and breaking it down into a series of tokens, which are then organized into a hierarchical structure that reflects the underlying syntax of the language. Once the AST is constructed, it can be used by various tools such as compilers, interpreters, and linters to analyze and manipulate the code. For example, a compiler might use the AST to generate machine code, while a linter might use it to check for style and syntax errors. Overall, the abstract syntax tree provides a way of representing the structure of code in a manner that can be easily analyzed and manipulated by other programs. It is a fundamental concept in the field of programming language design and implementation.",An abstract syntax tree (AST) is a tree-like data structure that represents the structure of code in a programming language.,"As I promised you last time, today I will talk about one of the central data structures that we’ll use throughout the rest of the series, so buckle up and let’s go.
Up until now, we had our interpreter and parser code mixed together and the interpreter would evaluate an expression as soon as the parser recognized a certain language construct like addition, subtraction, multiplication, or division. Such interpreters are called syntax-directed interpreters . They usually make a single pass over the input and are suitable for basic language applications. In order to analyze more complex Pascal programming language constructs, we need to build an intermediate representation ( IR ). Our parser will be responsible for building an IR and our interpreter will use it to interpret the input represented as the IR .
It turns out that a tree is a very suitable data structure for an IR .
Let’s quickly talk about tree terminology.
- A tree is a data structure that consists of one or more nodes organized into a hierarchy.
- The tree has one root , which is the top node.
- All nodes except the root have a unique parent .
- The node labeled * in the picture below is a parent . Nodes labeled 2 and 7 are its children ; children are ordered from left to right.
- A node with no children is called a leaf node.
- A node that has one or more children and that is not the root is called an interior node.
- The children can also be complete subtrees . In the picture below the left child (labeled * ) of the + node is a complete subtree with its own children.
- In computer science we draw trees upside down starting with the root node at the top and branches growing downward.
Here is a tree for the expression 2 * 7 + 3 with explanations:
The IR we’ll use throughout the series is called an abstract-syntax tree ( AST ). But before we dig deeper into ASTs let’s talk about parse trees briefly. Though we’re not going to use parse trees for our interpreter and compiler, they can help you understand how your parser interpreted the input by visualizing the execution trace of the parser. We’ll also compare them with ASTs to see why ASTs are better suited for intermediate representation than parse trees.
So, what is a parse tree? A parse-tree (sometimes called a concrete syntax tree ) is a tree that represents the syntactic structure of a language construct according to our grammar definition. It basically shows how your parser recognized the language construct or, in other words, it shows how the start symbol of your grammar derives a certain string in the programming language.
The call stack of the parser implicitly represents a parse tree and it’s automatically built in memory by your parser as it is trying to recognize a certain language construct.
Let’s take a look at a parse tree for the expression 2 * 7 + 3:
In the picture above you can see that:
- The parse tree records a sequence of rules the parser applies to recognize the input.
- The root of the parse tree is labeled with the grammar start symbol.
- Each interior node represents a non-terminal, that is it represents a grammar rule application, like expr , term , or factor in our case.
- Each leaf node represents a token.
As I’ve already mentioned, we’re not going to manually construct parser trees and use them for our interpreter but parse trees can help you understand how the parser interpreted the input by visualizing the parser call sequence.
You can see how parse trees look like for different arithmetic expressions by trying out a small utility called genptdot.py that I quickly wrote to help you visualize them. To use the utility you first need to install Graphviz package and after you’ve run the following command, you can open the generated image file parsetree.png and see a parse tree for the expression you passed as a command line argument:
$ python genptdot.py ""14 + 2 * 3 - 6 / 2"" > \ parsetree.dot && dot -Tpng -o parsetree.png parsetree.dot
Here is the generated image parsetree.png for the expression 14 + 2 * 3 - 6 / 2:
Play with the utility a bit by passing it different arithmetic expressions and see what a parse tree looks like for a particular expression.
Now, let’s talk about abstract-syntax trees ( AST ). This is the intermediate representation ( IR ) that we’ll heavily use throughout the rest of the series. It is one of the central data structures for our interpreter and future compiler projects.
Let’s start our discussion by taking a look at both the AST and the parse tree for the expression 2 * 7 + 3:
As you can see from the picture above, the AST captures the essence of the input while being smaller.
Here are the main differences between ASTs and Parse trees:
- ASTs uses operators/operations as root and interior nodes and it uses operands as their children.
- ASTs do not use interior nodes to represent a grammar rule, unlike the parse tree does.
- ASTs don’t represent every detail from the real syntax (that’s why they’re called abstract ) - no rule nodes and no parentheses, for example.
- ASTs are dense compared to a parse tree for the same language construct.
So, what is an abstract syntax tree? An abstract syntax tree ( AST ) is a tree that represents the abstract syntactic structure of a language construct where each interior node and the root node represents an operator, and the children of the node represent the operands of that operator.
I’ve already mentioned that ASTs are more compact than parse trees. Let’s take a look at an AST and a parse tree for the expression 7 + ((2 + 3)). You can see that the following AST is much smaller than the parse tree, but still captures the essence of the input:
So far so good, but how do you encode operator precedence in an AST ? In order to encode the operator precedence in AST , that is, to represent that “X happens before Y” you just need to put X lower in the tree than Y. And you’ve already seen that in the previous pictures.
Let’s take a look at some more examples.
In the picture below, on the left, you can see an AST for the expression 2 * 7 + 3. Let’s change the precedence by putting 7 + 3 inside the parentheses. You can see, on the right, what an AST looks like for the modified expression 2 * (7 + 3):
Here is an AST for the expression 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5:
From the pictures above you can see that operators with higher precedence end up being lower in the tree.
Okay, let’s write some code to implement different AST node types and modify our parser to generate an AST tree composed of those nodes.
First, we’ll create a base node class called AST that other classes will inherit from:
class AST(object): pass
Not much there, actually. Recall that ASTs represent the operator-operand model. So far, we have four operators and integer operands. The operators are addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. We could have created a separate class to represent each operator like AddNode, SubNode, MulNode, and DivNode, but instead we’re going to have only one BinOp class to represent all four binary operators (a binary operator is an operator that operates on two operands):
class BinOp(AST): def __init__(self, left, op, right): self.left = left self.token = self.op = op self.right = right
The parameters to the constructor are left , op , and right , where left and right point correspondingly to the node of the left operand and to the node of the right operand. Op holds a token for the operator itself: Token( PLUS , ‘+’) for the plus operator, Token( MINUS , ‘-‘) for the minus operator, and so on.
To represent integers in our AST , we’ll define a class Num that will hold an INTEGER token and the token’s value:
class Num(AST): def __init__(self, token): self.token = token self.value = token.value
As you’ve noticed, all nodes store the token used to create the node. This is mostly for convenience and it will come in handy in the future.
Recall the AST for the expression 2 * 7 + 3. We’re going to manually create it in code for that expression:
>>> from spi import Token, MUL, PLUS, INTEGER, Num, BinOp >>> >>> mul_token = Token(MUL, '*') >>> plus_token = Token(PLUS, '+') >>> mul_node = BinOp( ... left=Num(Token(INTEGER, 2)), ... op=mul_token, ... right=Num(Token(INTEGER, 7)) ... ) >>> add_node = BinOp( ... left=mul_node, ... op=plus_token, ... right=Num(Token(INTEGER, 3)) ... )
Here is how an AST will look with our new node classes defined. The picture below also follows the manual construction process above:
Here is our modified parser code that builds and returns an AST as a result of recognizing the input (an arithmetic expression):
class AST(object): pass class BinOp(AST): def __init__(self, left, op, right): self.left = left self.token = self.op = op self.right = right class Num(AST): def __init__(self, token): self.token = token self.value = token.value class Parser(object): def __init__(self, lexer): self.lexer = lexer # set current token to the first token taken from the input self.current_token = self.lexer.get_next_token() def error(self): raise Exception('Invalid syntax') def eat(self, token_type): # compare the current token type with the passed token # type and if they match then ""eat"" the current token # and assign the next token to the self.current_token, # otherwise raise an exception. if self.current_token.type == token_type: self.current_token = self.lexer.get_next_token() else: self.error() def factor(self): """"""factor : INTEGER | LPAREN expr RPAREN"""""" token = self.current_token if token.type == INTEGER: self.eat(INTEGER) return Num(token) elif token.type == LPAREN: self.eat(LPAREN) node = self.expr() self.eat(RPAREN) return node def term(self): """"""term : factor ((MUL | DIV) factor)*"""""" node = self.factor() while self.current_token.type in (MUL, DIV): token = self.current_token if token.type == MUL: self.eat(MUL) elif token.type == DIV: self.eat(DIV) node = BinOp(left=node, op=token, right=self.factor()) return node def expr(self): """""" expr : term ((PLUS | MINUS) term)* term : factor ((MUL | DIV) factor)* factor : INTEGER | LPAREN expr RPAREN """""" node = self.term() while self.current_token.type in (PLUS, MINUS): token = self.current_token if token.type == PLUS: self.eat(PLUS) elif token.type == MINUS: self.eat(MINUS) node = BinOp(left=node, op=token, right=self.term()) return node def parse(self): return self.expr()
Let’s go over the process of an AST construction for some arithmetic expressions.
If you look at the parser code above you can see that the way it builds nodes of an AST is that each BinOp node adopts the current value of the node variable as its left child and the result of a call to a term or factor as its right child, so it’s effectively pushing down nodes to the left and the tree for the expression 1 +2 + 3 + 4 + 5 below is a good example of that. Here is a visual representation how the parser gradually builds an AST for the expression 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5:
To help you visualize ASTs for different arithmetic expressions, I wrote a small utility that takes an arithmetic expression as its first argument and generates a DOT file that is then processed by the dot utility to actually draw an AST for you ( dot is part of the Graphviz package that you need to install to run the dot command). Here is a command and a generated AST image for the expression 7 + 3 * (10 / (12 / (3 + 1) - 1)):
$ python genastdot.py ""7 + 3 * (10 / (12 / (3 + 1) - 1))"" > \ ast.dot && dot -Tpng -o ast.png ast.dot
It’s worth your while to write some arithmetic expressions, manually draw ASTs for the expressions, and then verify them by generating AST images for the same expressions with the genastdot.py tool. That will help you better understand how ASTs are constructed by the parser for different arithmetic expressions.
Okay, here is an AST for the expression 2 * 7 + 3:
How do you navigate the tree to properly evaluate the expression represented by that tree? You do that by using a postorder traversal - a special case of depth-first traversal - which starts at the root node and recursively visits the children of each node from left to right. The postorder traversal visits nodes as far away from the root as fast as it can.
Here is a pseudo code for the postorder traversal where <<postorder actions>> is a placeholder for actions like addition, subtraction, multiplication, or division for a BinOp node or a simpler action like returning the integer value of a Num node:
The reason we’re going to use a postorder traversal for our interpreter is that first, we need to evaluate interior nodes lower in the tree because they represent operators with higher precedence and second, we need to evaluate operands of an operator before applying the operator to those operands. In the picture below, you can see that with postorder traversal we first evaluate the expression 2 * 7 and only after that we evaluate 14 + 3, which gives us the correct result, 17:
For the sake of completeness, I’ll mention that there are three types of depth-first traversal: preorder traversal , inorder traversal , and postorder traversal . The name of the traversal method comes from the place where you put actions in the visitation code:
Sometimes you might have to execute certain actions at all those points (preorder, inorder, and postorder). You’ll see some examples of that in the source code repository for this article.
Okay, let’s write some code to visit and interpret the abstract syntax trees built by our parser, shall we?
Here is the source code that implements the Visitor pattern :
class NodeVisitor(object): def visit(self, node): method_name = 'visit_' + type(node).__name__ visitor = getattr(self, method_name, self.generic_visit) return visitor(node) def generic_visit(self, node): raise Exception('No visit_{} method'.format(type(node).__name__))
And here is the source code of our Interpreter class that inherits from the NodeVisitor class and implements different methods that have the form visit_NodeType , where NodeType is replaced with the node’s class name like BinOp , Num and so on:
class Interpreter(NodeVisitor): def __init__(self, parser): self.parser = parser def visit_BinOp(self, node): if node.op.type == PLUS: return self.visit(node.left) + self.visit(node.right) elif node.op.type == MINUS: return self.visit(node.left) - self.visit(node.right) elif node.op.type == MUL: return self.visit(node.left) * self.visit(node.right) elif node.op.type == DIV: return self.visit(node.left) / self.visit(node.right) def visit_Num(self, node): return node.value
There are two interesting things about the code that are worth mentioning here: First, the visitor code that manipulates AST nodes is decoupled from the AST nodes themselves. You can see that none of the AST node classes (BinOp and Num) provide any code to manipulate the data stored in those nodes. That logic is encapsulated in the Interpreter class that implements the NodeVisitor class.
Second, instead of a giant if statement in the NodeVisitor’s visit method like this:
def visit(node): node_type = type(node).__name__ if node_type == 'BinOp': return self.visit_BinOp(node) elif node_type == 'Num': return self.visit_Num(node) elif ... # ...
or like this:
def visit(node): if isinstance(node, BinOp): return self.visit_BinOp(node) elif isinstance(node, Num): return self.visit_Num(node) elif ...
the NodeVisitor’s visit method is very generic and dispatches calls to the appropriate method based on the node type passed to it. As I’ve mentioned before, in order to make use of it, our interpreter inherits from the NodeVisitor class and implements necessary methods. So if the type of a node passed to the visit method is BinOp, then the visit method will dispatch the call to the visit_BinOp method, and if the type of a node is Num, then the visit method will dispatch the call to the visit_Num method, and so on.
Spend some time studying this approach (standard Python module ast uses the same mechanism for node traversal) as we will be extending our interpreter with many new visit_NodeType methods in the future.
The generic_visit method is a fallback that raises an exception to indicate that it encountered a node that the implementation class has no corresponding visit_NodeType method for.
Now, let’s manually build an AST for the expression 2 * 7 + 3 and pass it to our interpreter to see the visit method in action to evaluate the expression. Here is how you can do it from the Python shell:
>>> from spi import Token, MUL, PLUS, INTEGER, Num, BinOp >>> >>> mul_token = Token(MUL, '*') >>> plus_token = Token(PLUS, '+') >>> mul_node = BinOp( ... left=Num(Token(INTEGER, 2)), ... op=mul_token, ... right=Num(Token(INTEGER, 7)) ... ) >>> add_node = BinOp( ... left=mul_node, ... op=plus_token, ... right=Num(Token(INTEGER, 3)) ... ) >>> from spi import Interpreter >>> inter = Interpreter(None) >>> inter.visit(add_node) 17
As you can see, I passed the root of the expression tree to the visit method and that triggered traversal of the tree by dispatching calls to the correct methods of the Interpreter class( visit_BinOp and visit_Num ) and generating the result.
Okay, here is the complete code of our new interpreter for your convenience:

Save the above code into the spi.py file or download it directly from GitHub . Try it out and see for yourself that your new tree-based interpreter properly evaluates arithmetic expressions.
Here is a sample session:
$ python spi.py spi> 7 + 3 * (10 / (12 / (3 + 1) - 1)) 22 spi> 7 + 3 * (10 / (12 / (3 + 1) - 1)) / (2 + 3) - 5 - 3 + (8) 10 spi> 7 + (((3 + 2))) 12
Today you’ve learned about parse trees, ASTs, how to construct ASTs and how to traverse them to interpret the input represented by those ASTs. You’ve also modified the parser and the interpreter and split them apart. The current interface between the lexer, parser, and the interpreter now looks like this:
You can read that as “The parser gets tokens from the lexer and then returns the generated AST for the interpreter to traverse and interpret the input.”
That’s it for today, but before wrapping up I’d like to talk briefly about recursive-descent parsers, namely just give them a definition because I promised last time to talk about them in more detail. So here you go: a recursive-descent parser is a top-down parser that uses a set of recursive procedures to process the input. Top-down reflects the fact that the parser begins by constructing the top node of the parse tree and then gradually constructs lower nodes.
And now it’s time for exercises :)
- Write a translator (hint: node visitor) that takes as input an arithmetic expression and prints it out in postfix notation, also known as Reverse Polish Notation ( RPN ). For example, if the input to the translator is the expression (5 + 3) * 12 / 3 than the output should be 5 3 + 12 * 3 /. See the answer here but try to solve it first on your own.
- Write a translator (node visitor) that takes as input an arithmetic expression and prints it out in LISP style notation, that is 2 + 3 would become (+ 2 3) and (2 + 3 * 5) would become (+ 2 (* 3 5)). You can find the answer here but again try to solve it first before looking at the provided solution.
In the next article, we’ll add assignment and unary operators to our growing Pascal interpreter. Until then, have fun and see you soon.
P.S. I’ve also provided a Rust implementation of the interpreter that you can find on GitHub . This is a way for me to learn Rust so keep in mind that the code might not be “idiomatic” yet. Comments and suggestions as to how to make the code better are always welcome.

Is there anything else you would like to know?",Babies cry when they're tired because crying is their way to communicate discomfort when feelings of exhaustion start to mount.,"Just give in to the sandman already, kid.
Seeing a mama struggling with a screaming toddler is hard. With the look of exhaustion and embarrassment on her face while the child screams bloody murder, it’s easy to feel her pain. Then she, unfortunately, feels the need to explain and says, “He missed his nap,” or “She’s so sleepy.” We send all the empathy vibes because we’ve all been there. And trying to understand why a child cries when they’re sleepy is the bane to parenthood.
But the behavior is common and explainable.
“There can be a few different reasons why a child fights going to sleep. In infants and young toddlers, resisting sleep occurs because they have not yet developed object permanence which is the understanding that things exist when we cannot see them,” says Amy Marschall, Psy. D and licensed child psychologist.
This means that your child may not grasp that you’ll still be there after they wake up. “Going to sleep means they can't see the caretaker, and this is distressing,” Marschall tells Romper.
Sometimes this battle continues beyond the first few years, and sleepy time is not that part of the day you look forward to. “Even kids who have an understanding of object permanence can get separation anxiety from the parent leaving them at bedtime. Older children might resist sleep because they are having fun playing and don't want to stop even if they are tired,” says Marschall.
Adults don’t always have the best attitude when they are tired. And I can personally say my family doesn’t always like me if I haven’t had proper rest. Children are the same. They just express it by crying.
“Crying is their way to communicate discomfort when feelings of exhaustion start to mount,” Lea Lis , MD and board-certified child psychiatrist, tells Romper.
According to experts like pediatric sleep psychologist Lynelle Schneeberg, 80% of preschooler parents report that their kids have issues getting to sleep.
Here are some strategies to help.
“Having a set bedtime and a routine that is the same, or very similar, every day really helps kids not fight sleep. The specifics of the routine can be based on the individual family, but generally, it's good to wind down and not engage in activities that bring the heart rate up during the few hours before bed,” Marschall tells Romper.
Sometimes kids are anxious or afraid. Marschall says, “Parents can encourage them to share what they are afraid of. Anxiety isn't rational, so if a child says they are afraid of a monster, telling them there is no monster will likely not alleviate their anxiety. Instead, you can make monster spray or purchase a stuffed animal that has ‘magic powers’ to keep the child safe.”
Creating the space for your child to learn to sleep on their own is a must for the sake of your sleep cycle and theirs.
Lis says, “I would not get into the habit of staying in the room till they fall asleep or rubbing their back. It is important to make children great independent sleepers and let them self-soothe.” She suggests using transitional objects like a blanket or doll to help with the process.
Create your own way of rewarding your child for self-soothing.
Lis says you can, “Start a sticker chart, and if they stay in their room all night, give them stickers, rewards, and praise in the morning.”
It might take some time to break the crying habit, especially if you have a strong-willed child. But stay the course. They may not stop fully, but the crying times will start to cut short when they figure out how to calm themselves and drift to sleep.
“Sleep is the foundation to physical and mental health, as well as helping your child to grow and learn,” Lis says.

A meander is one of a series of regular sinuous curves in the channel of a river or other watercourse . It is produced as a watercourse erodes the sediments of an outer, concave bank ( cut bank or river cliff ) and deposits sediments on an inner, convex bank which is typically a point bar . The result of this coupled erosion and sedimentation is the formation of a sinuous course as the channel migrates back and forth across the axis of a floodplain . [1] [2]
The zone within which a meandering stream periodically shifts its channel is known as a meander belt . It typically ranges from 15 to 18 times the width of the channel. Over time, meanders migrate downstream, sometimes in such a short time as to create civil engineering challenges for local municipalities attempting to maintain stable roads and bridges. [1] [2]
The degree of meandering of the channel of a river, stream, or other watercourse is measured by its sinuosity . The sinuosity of a watercourse is the ratio of the length of the channel to the straight line down-valley distance. Streams or rivers with a single channel and sinuosities of 1.5 or more are defined as meandering streams or rivers. [1] [3]
The term derives from the winding river Menderes located in Asia-Minor and known to the Ancient Greeks as Μαίανδρος Maiandros ( Latin : Maeander ), [4] [5] characterised by a very convoluted path along the lower reach. As a result, even in Classical Greece (and in later Greek thought) the name of the river had become a common noun meaning anything convoluted and winding, such as decorative patterns or speech and ideas, as well as the geomorphological feature. [6] Strabo said: ‘...its course is so exceedingly winding that everything winding is called meandering.’ [7]
The Meander River is south of Izmir, east of the ancient Greek town of Miletus , now Milet, Turkey. It flows through series of three graben in the Menderes Massif, but has a flood plain much wider than the meander zone in its lower reach. Its modern Turkish name is the Büyük Menderes River . [8]
Meanders are a result of the interaction of water flowing through a curved channel with the underlying river bed. This produces helicoidal flow , in which water moves from the outer to the inner bank along the river bed, then flows back to the outer bank near the surface of the river. This in turn increases carrying capacity for sediments on the outer bank and reduces it on the inner bank, so that sediments are eroded from the outer bank and redeposited on the inner bank of the next downstream meander. [9]
When a fluid is introduced to an initially straight channel which then bends, the sidewalls induce a pressure gradient that causes the fluid to alter course and follow the bend. From here, two opposing processes occur: (1) irrotational flow and (2) secondary flow . For a river to meander, secondary flow must dominate.
Irrotational flow : From Bernoulli's equations, high pressure results in low velocity. Therefore, in the absence of secondary flow we would expect low fluid velocity at the outside bend and high fluid velocity at the inside bend. This classic fluid mechanics result is irrotational vortex flow. In the context of meandering rivers, its effects are dominated by those of secondary flow.
Secondary flow : A force balance exists between pressure forces pointing to the inside bend of the river and centrifugal forces pointing to the outside bend of the river. In the context of meandering rivers, a boundary layer exists within the thin layer of fluid that interacts with the river bed. Inside that layer and following standard boundary-layer theory, the velocity of the fluid is effectively zero. Centrifugal force, which depends on velocity, is also therefore effectively zero. Pressure force, however, remains unaffected by the boundary layer. Therefore, within the boundary layer, pressure force dominates and fluid moves along the bottom of the river from the outside bend to the inside bend. This initiates helicoidal flow: Along the river bed, fluid roughly follows the curve of the channel but is also forced toward the inside bend; away from the river bed, fluid also roughly follows the curve of the channel but is forced, to some extent, from the inside to the outside bend.
The higher velocities at the outside bend lead to higher shear stresses and therefore result in erosion. Similarly, lower velocities at the inside bend cause lower sheer stresses and deposition occurs. Thus meander bends erode at the outside bend, causing the river to becoming increasingly sinuous (until cutoff events occur). Deposition at the inside bend occurs such that for most natural meandering rivers, the river width remains nearly constant, even as the river evolves. [10]
In a speech before the Prussian Academy of Sciences in 1926, Albert Einstein suggested that because the Coriolis force of the earth can cause a small imbalance in velocity distribution, such that velocity on one bank is higher than on the other, it could trigger the erosion on one bank and deposition of sediment on the other that produces meanders [11] However, Coriolis forces are likely insignificant compared with other forces acting to produce river meanders. [12]
The technical description of a meandering watercourse is termed meander geometry or meander planform geometry. [13] It is characterized as an irregular waveform . Ideal waveforms, such as a sine wave , are one line thick, but in the case of a stream the width must be taken into consideration. The bankfull width is the distance across the bed at an average cross-section at the full-stream level, typically estimated by the line of lowest vegetation.
As a waveform the meandering stream follows the down-valley axis, a straight line fitted to the curve such that the sum of all the amplitudes measured from it is zero. This axis represents the overall direction of the stream.
At any cross-section the flow is following the sinuous axis, the centerline of the bed. Two consecutive crossing points of sinuous and down-valley axes define a meander loop. The meander is two consecutive loops pointing in opposite transverse directions. The distance of one meander along the down-valley axis is the meander length or wavelength . The maximum distance from the down-valley axis to the sinuous axis of a loop is the meander width or amplitude . The course at that point is the apex.
In contrast to sine waves, the loops of a meandering stream are more nearly circular. The curvature varies from a maximum at the apex to zero at a crossing point (straight line), also called an inflection, because the curvature changes direction in that vicinity. The radius of the loop is the straight line perpendicular to the down-valley axis intersecting the sinuous axis at the apex. As the loop is not ideal, additional information is needed to characterize it. The orientation angle is the angle between sinuous axis and down-valley axis at any point on the sinuous axis.
A loop at the apex has an outer or concave bank and an inner or convex bank. The meander belt is defined by an average meander width measured from outer bank to outer bank instead of from centerline to centerline. If there is a flood plain , it extends beyond the meander belt. The meander is then said to be free—it can be found anywhere in the flood plain. If there is no flood plain, the meanders are fixed.
Various mathematical formulae relate the variables of the meander geometry. As it turns out some numerical parameters can be established, which appear in the formulae. The waveform depends ultimately on the characteristics of the flow but the parameters are independent of it and apparently are caused by geologic factors. In general the meander length is 10–14 times, with an average 11 times, the fullbank channel width and 3 to 5 times, with an average of 4.7 times, the radius of curvature at the apex. This radius is 2–3 times the channel width. [14]
A meander has a depth pattern as well. The cross-overs are marked by riffles , or shallow beds, while at the apices are pools. In a pool direction of flow is downward, scouring the bed material. The major volume, however, flows more slowly on the inside of the bend where, due to decreased velocity, it deposits sediment. [15]
The line of maximum depth, or channel, is the thalweg or thalweg line. It is typically designated the borderline when rivers are used as political borders. The thalweg hugs the outer banks and returns to center over the riffles. The meander arc length is the distance along the thalweg over one meander. The river length is the length along the centerline. [15]
Once a channel begins to follow a sinusoidal path, the amplitude and concavity of the loops increase dramatically. This is due to the effect of helical flow which sweeps dense eroded material towards the inside of the bend, and leaves the outside of the bend unprotected and vulnerable to accelerated erosion. This establishes a positive feedback loop . In the words of Elizabeth A. Wood: ""...this process of making meanders seems to be a self-intensifying process...in which greater curvature results in more erosion of the bank, which results in greater curvature..."" [16]
The cross-current along the floor of the channel is part of the secondary flow and sweeps dense eroded material towards the inside of the bend. [17] The cross-current then rises to the surface near the inside and flows towards the outside, forming the helical flow . The greater the curvature of the bend, and the faster the flow, the stronger is the cross-current and the sweeping. [18]
Due to the conservation of angular momentum the speed on the inside of the bend is faster than on the outside. [19]
Since the flow velocity is diminished, so is the centrifugal pressure. The pressure of the super-elevated column prevails, developing an unbalanced gradient that moves water back across the bottom from the outside to the inside. The flow is supplied by a counter-flow across the surface from the inside to the outside. [20] This entire situation is very similar to the Tea leaf paradox . [21] This secondary flow carries sediment from the outside of the bend to the inside making the river more meandering. [22]
As to why streams of any size become sinuous in the first place, there are a number of theories, not necessarily mutually exclusive.
The stochastic theory can take many forms but one of the most general statements is that of Scheidegger: ""The meander train is assumed to be the result of the stochastic fluctuations of the direction of flow due to the random presence of direction-changing obstacles in the river path."" [23] Given a flat, smooth, tilted artificial surface, rainfall runs off it in sheets, but even in that case adhesion of water to the surface and cohesion of drops produce rivulets at random. Natural surfaces are rough and erodible to different degrees. The result of all the physical factors acting at random is channels that are not straight, which then progressively become sinuous. Even channels that appear straight have a sinuous thalweg that leads eventually to a sinuous channel.
In the equilibrium theory, meanders decrease the stream gradient until an equilibrium between the erodibility of the terrain and the transport capacity of the stream is reached. [24] A mass of water descending must give up potential energy , which, given the same velocity at the end of the drop as at the beginning, is removed by interaction with the material of the stream bed. The shortest distance; that is, a straight channel, results in the highest energy per unit of length, disrupting the banks more, creating more sediment and aggrading the stream. The presence of meanders allows the stream to adjust the length to an equilibrium energy per unit length in which the stream carries away all the sediment that it produces.
Geomorphic refers to the surface structure of the terrain. Morphotectonic means having to do with the deeper, or tectonic (plate) structure of the rock. The features included under these categories are not random and guide streams into non-random paths. They are predictable obstacles that instigate meander formation by deflecting the stream. For example, the stream might be guided into a fault line (morphotectonic). [25]
Main article: Cut bank
A cut bank is an often vertical bank or cliff that forms where the outside, concave bank of a meander cuts into the floodplain or valley wall of a river or stream. A cutbank is also known either as a river-cut cliff , river cliff , or a bluff and spelled as cutbank . [1] Erosion that forms a cut bank occurs at the outside bank of a meander because helicoidal flow of water keeps the bank washed clean of loose sand, silt, and sediment and subjects it to constant erosion. As a result, the meander erodes and migrates in the direction of the outside bend, forming the cut bank. [26] [27]
As the cut bank is undermined by erosion, it commonly collapses as slumps into the river channel. The slumped sediment, having been broken up by slumping, is readily eroded and carried toward the middle of the channel. The sediment eroded from a cut bank tends to be deposited on the point bar of the next downstream meander, and not on the point bar opposite it. [28] [26] This can be seen in areas where trees grow on the banks of rivers; on the inside of meanders, trees, such as willows, are often far from the bank, whilst on the outside of the bend, the tree roots are often exposed and undercut, eventually leading the trees to fall into the river. [28] [29]
Main article: Meander cutoff
A meander cutoff , also known as either a cutoff meander or abandoned meander , is a meander that has been abandoned by its stream after the formation of a neck cutoff. A lake that occupies a cutoff meander is known as an oxbow lake . Cutoff meanders that have cut downward into the underlying bedrock are known in general as incised cutoff meanders . [1] As in the case of the Anderson Bottom Rincon, incised meanders that have either steep-sided, often vertical walls, are often, but not always, known as rincons in the southwest United States . [30] Rincon in English is a nontechnical word in the southwest United States for either a small secluded valley, an alcove or angular recess in a cliff, or a bend in a river. [31]
Main article: Entrenched river
The meanders of a stream or river that has cut its bed down into the bedrock are known as either incised , intrenched , entrenched , inclosed or ingrown meanders . Some Earth scientists recognize and use a finer subdivision of incised meanders. Thornbury [32] argues that incised or inclosed meanders are synonyms that are appropriate to describe any meander incised downward into bedrock and defines enclosed or entrenched meanders as a subtype of incised meanders (inclosed meanders) characterized by a symmetrical valley sides. He argues that the symmetrical valley sides are the direct result of rapid down-cutting of a watercourse into bedrock. [1] [33] In addition, as proposed by Rich, [34] Thornbury argues that incised valleys with a pronounced asymmetry of cross section, which he called ingrown meanders , are the result of the lateral migration and incision of a meander during a period of slower channel downcutting . Regardless, the formation of both entrenched meanders and ingrown meanders is thought to require that base level falls as a result of either relative change in mean sea level , isostatic or tectonic uplift, the breach of an ice or landslide dam, or regional tilting. Classic examples of incised meanders are associated with rivers in the Colorado Plateau , the Kentucky River Palisades in central Kentucky , and streams in the Ozark Plateau . [33] [35]
As noted above, it was initially either argued or presumed that an incised meander is characteristic of an antecedent stream or river that had incised its channel into underlying strata . An antecedent stream or river is one that maintains its original course and pattern during incision despite the changes in underlying rock topography and rock types. [32] [33] However, later geologists [36] argue that the shape of an incised meander is not always, if ever, ""inherited"", e.g., strictly from an antecedent meandering stream where its meander pattern could freely develop on a level floodplain. Instead, they argue that as fluvial incision of bedrock proceeds, the stream course is significantly modified by variations in rock type and fractures , faults , and other geological structures into either lithologically conditioned meanders or structurally controlled meanders . [33] [35]
Main article: Oxbow lake
The oxbow lake , which is the most common type of fluvial lake, is a crescent-shaped lake that derives its name from its distinctive curved shape. [37] Oxbow lakes are also known as cutoff lakes . [1] Such lakes form regularly in undisturbed floodplains as a result of the normal process of fluvial meandering. Either a river or stream forms a sinuous channel as the outer side of its bends are eroded away and sediments accumulate on the inner side, which forms a meandering horseshoe-shaped bend. Eventually as the result of its meandering, the fluvial channel cuts through the narrow neck of the meander and forms a cutoff meander. The final break-through of the neck, which is called a neck cutoff , often occurs during a major flood because that is when the watercourse is out of its banks and can flow directly across the neck and erode it with the full force of the flood. [28] [38]
After a cutoff meander is formed, river water flows into its end from the river builds small delta-like feature into either end of it during floods. These delta-like features block either end of the cutoff meander to form a stagnant oxbow lake that is separated from the flow of the fluvial channel and independent of the river. During floods, the flood waters deposit fine-grained sediment into the oxbow lake. As a result, oxbow lakes tend to become filled in with fine-grained, organic-rich sediments over time. [28] [38]
Main article: Point bar
A point bar , which is also known as a meander bar , is a fluvial bar that is formed by the slow, often episodic, addition of individual accretions of noncohesive sediment on the inside bank of a meander by the accompanying migration of the channel toward its outer bank. [1] [26] This process is called lateral accretion. Lateral accretion occurs mostly during high water or floods when the point bar is submerged. Typically, the sediment consists of either sand, gravel, or a combination of both. The sediment comprising some point bars might grade downstream into silty sediments. Because of the decreasing velocity and strength of current from the thalweg of the channel to the upper surface of point bar when the sediment is deposited the vertical sequence of sediments comprising a point bar becomes finer upward within an individual point bar. For example, it is typical for point bars to fine upward from gravel at the base to fine sands at the top. The source of the sediment is typically upstream cut banks from which sand, rocks and debris has been eroded, swept, and rolled across the bed of the river and downstream to the inside bank of a river bend. On the inside bend, this sediment and debris is eventually deposited on the slip-off slope of a point bar. [1] [26] [27]
Scroll-bars are a result of continuous lateral migration of a meander loop that creates an asymmetrical ridge and swale topography [39] on the inside of the bends. The topography is generally parallel to the meander, and is related to migrating bar forms and back bar chutes, [40] which carve sediment from the outside of the curve and deposit sediment in the slower flowing water on the inside of the loop, in a process called lateral accretion. Scroll-bar sediments are characterized by cross-bedding and a pattern of fining upward. [41] These characteristics are a result of the dynamic river system, where larger grains are transported during high energy flood events and then gradually die down, depositing smaller material with time (Batty 2006). Deposits for meandering rivers are generally homogeneous and laterally extensive unlike the more heterogeneous braided river deposits. [42] There are two distinct patterns of scroll-bar depositions; the eddy accretion scroll bar pattern and the point-bar scroll pattern. When looking down the river valley they can be distinguished because the point-bar scroll patterns are convex and the eddy accretion scroll bar patterns are concave. [43]
Scroll bars often look lighter at the tops of the ridges and darker in the swales. This is because the tops can be shaped by wind, either adding fine grains or by keeping the area unvegetated, while the darkness in the swales can be attributed to silts and clays washing in during high water periods. This added sediment in addition to water that catches in the swales is in turn is a favorable environment for vegetation that will also accumulate in the swales.
Main article: Slip-off slope
Depending upon whether a meander is part of an entrenched river or part of a freely meandering river within a floodplain, the term slip-off slope can refer to two different fluvial landforms that comprise the inner, convex, bank of a meander loop. In case of a freely meandering river on a floodplain, a slip-off slope is the inside, gently sloping bank of a meander on which sediments episodically accumulate to form a point bar as a river meanders. This type of slip-off slope is located opposite the cutbank. [44] This term can also be applied to the inside, sloping bank of a meandering tidal channel. [45]
In case of an entrenched river, a slip-off slope is a gently sloping bedrock surface that rises from the inside, concave bank of an asymmetrically entrenched river. This type of slip-off slope is often covered by a thin, discontinuous layer of alluvium. It is produced by the gradual outward migration of the meander as a river cuts downward into bedrock. [46] [47] A terrace on the slip-off slope of a meander spur, known as slip-off slope terrace , can formed by a brief halt during the irregular incision by an actively meandering river. [48]
The meander ratio [49] or sinuosity index [50] is a means of quantifying how much a river or stream meanders (how much its course deviates from the shortest possible path). It is calculated as the length of the stream divided by the length of the valley . A perfectly straight river would have a meander ratio of 1 (it would be the same length as its valley), while the higher this ratio is above 1, the more the river meanders.
Sinuosity indices are calculated from the map or from an aerial photograph measured over a distance called the reach , which should be at least 20 times the average fullbank channel width. The length of the stream is measured by channel, or thalweg, length over the reach, while the bottom value of the ratio is the downvalley length or air distance of the stream between two points on it defining the reach.
The sinuosity index plays a part in mathematical descriptions of streams. The index may require elaboration, because the valley may meander as well—i.e., the downvalley length is not identical to the reach. In that case the valley index is the meander ratio of the valley while the channel index is the meander ratio of the channel. The channel sinuosity index is the channel length divided by the valley length and the standard sinuosity index is the channel index divided by the valley index. Distinctions may become even more subtle. [51]
Sinuosity Index has a non-mathematical utility as well. Streams can be placed in categories arranged by it; for example, when the index is between 1 and 1.5 the river is sinuous, but if between 1.5 and 4, then meandering. The index is a measure also of stream velocity and sediment load, those quantities being maximized at an index of 1 (straight).

In heads-up, the player who was the Big Blind gets the extra chip.","When two players have the same five-card hand, the pot is split evenly between them.","From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia
In poker it is sometimes necessary to split , or divide the pot among two or more players rather than awarding it all to a single player. This can happen because of ties, and also by playing intentional split-pot poker variants (the most typical of these is high-low split poker , where the high hand and low hand split the pot).
To split a pot, one player uses both hands to take the chips from the pot and make stacks, placing them side by side to compare height (and therefore value). Equal stacks are placed aside. If there is more than one denomination of chip in the pot, the largest value chip is done first, and then progressively smaller value chips. If there is an odd number of larger chips, smaller chips from the pot can be used to equalize stacks or make change as necessary. Pots are always split down to the lowest denomination of chip used in the game. Three-way ties or further splits can also be done this way.
After fully dividing a pot, there may be a single odd lowest-denomination chip remaining (or two odd chips if splitting three ways, etc.). Odd chips can be awarded in several ways, agreed upon before the beginning of the game. The following rules are common:
- If playing a high-low split game and dividing a pot between the high and low hands, always award the odd chip to the high hand.
- If splitting a pot because of tied hands, award the odd chip to the hand that contains the highest-ranking single card, using suits to break ties if necessary (clubs ranking the lowest, followed by diamonds, hearts, and spades as in bridge ).
- (Variation) Between tied hands, award the odd chip to the first player in clockwise rotation from the dealer. (Note that in a casino stud game with a house dealer and no button this gives an unfair advantage to players on the dealer's left, so the high card by suit method is preferred).
- (Variation) Leave the odd chip as an extra ante for the next deal. This is common in home games.
Sometimes it is necessary to further split a half pot into quarters, or even smaller portions. This is especially common in community card high-low split games such as Omaha hold'em , where one player has the high hand and two or more players have tied low hands. Unfortunate players receiving such a fractional pot call it being quartered . When this happens, an exception to the odd chip rules above can be made: if the high hand wins its half of the pot alone, and the low half is going to be quartered, the odd chip (if any) from the first split should be placed in the low half, rather than being awarded to the high hand.",source_text/a3a39fac491d02e9c580133f8c530f4bcdf4c493c282d33ed750cc6eedd604a2-neeva_0_0.txt,,no_support,True,chip - pot - extra - split - poker - evenly - odd - dealer - gets - headsup,StanfordCitation,0.51,0.49,0.48,0.48,[0.123898945748806],[0.123898945748806]

It was originally a Scottish surname meaning Mack's stream, from the name Mack, a short form of the personal name Magnus. The name is derived from a place near Melrose in the former county of Roxburgh. It was first recorded in 1144, when Herbert de Maccusweil moved to Scotland from England. The ancient family seat of the Maxwell family was Caerlaverock Castle, located near the border of Scotland and England.",The name is derived from a place near Melrose in the former county of Roxburgh.,"SDB Popularity ranking: 1056
This surname of Scottish origin is derived from a place near Melrose in the former county of Roxburgh. The placename originated when Maccus, son of Undewyn, a Saxon lord, in the reign of David 1, obtained a grant of land on the Tweed River before 1150 and from the salmon pool attached thereto called 'Maccus's Wiel'; the lands obtained their name. Maccus derives from the Old Norse given name 'Makkr' a form of 'Magnus' meaning 'great' plus the Old English pre 7th Century 'wael', 'well' or 'pool', hence 'the pool of Maccus'. The placename was recorded in 1144 as Mackeswell and the surname dates back to the late 12th Century, (see below). Further recordings include John de Maccuswell (1221) 'The Calendar of Patent Rolls, Scotland' and Eymer de Mackisuuell (1262) 'peeples'. Variations in the idiom of the spelling include Maxwale, Maxweell, Maxwaile, etc.. One Johane Maxwell was christened on May 1st 1547 at St. Antholin Budge Row, London, and William Hamilton Maxwell (1792 - 1850) was an Irish novelist who graduated at Trinity College Dublin and served in the peninsular campaign and at Waterloo. The first recorded spelling of the family name is shown to be that of Harboured de Makeswell, which was dated 1190, in the Pipe Rolls of Yorkshire, during the reign of King William, known as 'The Lion of Scotland', 1165 - 1214. Surnames became necessary when governments introduced personal taxation. In England this was known as Poll Tax. Throughout the centuries, surnames in every country have continued to ""develop"" often leading to astonishing variants of the original spelling.

What did Tyra Banks win an Emmy for?
At what age did Tyra Banks start modeling?
Tyra Banks , in full Tyra Lynne Banks , (born December 4, 1973, Inglewood, California , U.S.), American fashion model and television personality best known as a face of the cosmetics company CoverGirl and the American lingerie, clothing , and cosmetics retailer Victoria’s Secret, as well as for her daily television talk show , The Tyra Banks Show (2005–10), and for hosting the modeling competition series America’s Next Top Model (2003–15, 2017–18).
Banks was raised in Inglewood , a suburb of Los Angeles , where she attended a local all-girls Catholic school. Her father was employed as a computer consultant, and her mother worked as a photographer. Banks started modeling at age 15 and, with the help of her mother, assembled a modeling portfolio. At age 17 she began seeking professional representation from local modeling agencies. Despite initial rejection—allegedly because of her “ethnic” look—Banks signed in 1990 for professional representation with Elite Model Management, one of the world’s top modeling agencies. Soon afterward she was featured in the leading teen magazine, Seventeen . After graduating from high school in 1991, Banks enrolled in Loyola Marymount University, but her plans changed when a French modeling scout offered her the opportunity to model high-fashion collections on the runways of Paris . Banks walked a record 25 shows in her first season and subsequently appeared on the cover of the Spanish edition of the leading fashion magazine Vogue , and she was soon christened the “new Naomi Campbell .”
Banks started her own company to manage her career and thereafter patterned her career trajectory after that of her idol, supermodel Cindy Crawford , venturing into multiple industries. Banks was subsequently featured in a string of pop music videos including Michael Jackson ’s “Black or White” (1991), Tina Turner ’s “Love Thing” (1992), and George Michael’s “Too Funky” (1992). In 1992 she returned from Paris, and in 1993 she was featured in a recurring role on several episodes of the television comedy series The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air (1990–96), a Will Smith vehicle. In the same year, she became a new face of CoverGirl, which catapulted her to the status of supermodel—a top fashion model who appears simultaneously on the covers of the world’s leading fashion magazines and is globally recognized by first name only. In 1994 and again in 1996 she was named one of People magazine’s “50 Most Beautiful People.” She made her movie debut in the dramatic film Higher Learning (1995).
In the mid-1990s, because of her increasingly curvaceous figure, Banks began to lose runway assignments. Refusing to cave to industry pressure to lose weight, she instead shifted her focus toward modeling lingerie and swimwear, which typically favours models with more shapely physiques. She became the first African American woman to be featured on the cover of GQ magazine (February 1996), the Sports Illustrated swimsuit issue (with fellow top model Valeria Mazza), and the Victoria’s Secret catalog. In 1997 she became one of the original Victoria’s Secret Angels—the brand’s most visible spokesmodels. She subsequently launched her own film and television production company, Bankable Productions, and cofounded with her mother the Tyra Banks TZONE Foundation, dedicated to the advancement of opportunities for low-income and disadvantaged girls through the operation of various programs and services including self-esteem workshops. With Vanessa Thomas Bush she wrote Tyra’s Beauty Inside & Out (1998), a collection of beauty, health, and fashion tips.
In the early 21st century Banks continued to expand her career, appearing in Coyote Ugly (2000), a rowdy coming-of-age feature film, and releasing a music single, “Shake Ya Body” (2004), which garnered little attention.
In 2003 Banks signed on as the host and executive producer of America’s Next Top Model , a weekly prime-time reality talent show that chronicled the search for a promising fashion model from a lineup of neophytes. It swiftly became one of the highest-rated shows in the history of the UPN (United Paramount Network). The show later aired on the CW, a network created when UPN merged with Warner Brothers’ The WB. It became a cultural touchstone , with many of Banks’s memorable neologisms working their way into the lexicon. Although America’s Next Top Model was canceled in 2015, it returned the following year, airing on the cable channel VH1. Banks hosted the show in 2017–18.
Banks premiered her own daily talk show, The Tyra Banks Show , in 2005. It focused on fashion, lifestyle, makeovers, and topical issues and featured Banks at the centre of a reality-show-like twist: in taped confessional segments she divulged her own struggles with a variety of issues, including low self-esteem and her inability to find and keep a suitable mate. She retired from modeling that same year. In both 2008 and 2009 The Tyra Banks Show won an Emmy Award for outstanding talk show in the newly created “informative” category. The program ended in 2010.
During this time, Banks continued to occasionally act, and she appeared on such TV shows as Gossip Girl , Glee , and Black-ish . In 2017–18 she hosted the reality TV series America’s Got Talent . In 2020 she began hosting Dancing with the Stars .
Banks participated in a number of unsuccessful ventures , including the reality television series True Beauty (2009–10), the Web site Type F (2011), which offered beauty and fashion advice, and the talk show FabLife (2015). She began offering her own line of cosmetics in 2014 and in 2015 launched a Web site that sold her makeup and dispensed tips on cosmetic application.",source_text/7b8a3423f328bfa3c6cd3b48ca5d4c7ec203380a1f41858c3ddfbe8676287ebe-neeva_0_0.txt,"Banks walked a record 25 shows in her first season and subsequently appeared on the cover of the Spanish edition of the leading fashion magazine Vogue, and she was soon christened the “new Naomi Campbell.”",complete_support,False,americas - talent - got - winner - grammy - awards - idol - chef - kitchen - hells,StanfordCitation,0.82,0.6133333333333333,0.52,0.5,[0.8925952315330505],[0.8925952315330505]

And a small cabin build there, of clay and wattles made;
Nine bean rows will I have there, a hive for the honey bee,
And live alone in the bee-loud glade .
And I shall have some peace there, for peace comes dropping slow,
Dropping from the veils of the morning to where the cricket sings;
There midnight's all a glimmer, and noon a purple glow,
And evening full of the linnet's wings.
I will arise and go now, for always night and day
I hear lake water lapping with low sounds by the shore;
While I stand on the roadway, or on the pavements grey,
I hear it in the deep heart's core.
"" The Lake Isle of Innisfree "" is a twelve-line poem comprising three quatrains , written by William Butler Yeats in 1888 and first published in the National Observer in 1890. It was reprinted in The Countess Kathleen and Various Legends and Lyrics in 1892 and as an illustrated Cuala Press Broadside in 1932.
""The Lake Isle of Innisfree"" exemplifies the style of the Celtic Revival : it is an attempt to create a form of poetry that was Irish in origin rather than one that adhered to the standards set by English poets and critics. [1] It received critical acclaim in the United Kingdom and France . [2] The poem is featured in Irish passports . [3]
Lake Isle of Innisfree is an uninhabited island within Lough Gill , in Ireland , near which Yeats spent his summers as a child. Yeats describes the inspiration for the poem coming from a ""sudden"" memory of his childhood while walking down Fleet Street in London in 1888. He writes, ""I had still the ambition, formed in Sligo in my teens, of living in imitation of Thoreau on Innisfree, a little island in Lough Gill, and when walking through Fleet Street very homesick I heard a little tinkle of water and saw a fountain in a shop-window which balanced a little ball upon its jet, and began to remember lake water. From the sudden remembrance came my poem ""Innisfree,"" my first lyric with anything in its rhythm of my own music. I had begun to loosen rhythm as an escape from rhetoric and from that emotion of the crowd that rhetoric brings, but I only understood vaguely and occasionally that I must for my special purpose use nothing but the common syntax. A couple of years later I could not have written that first line with its conventional archaism—""Arise and go""—nor the inversion of the last stanza."" [4]
The twelve-line poem is divided into three quatrains and is an example of Yeats's earlier lyric poems. The poem expresses the speaker's longing for the peace and tranquility of Innisfree while residing in an urban setting. He can escape the noise of the city and be lulled by the ""lake water lapping with low sounds by the shore."" On this small island, he can return to nature by growing beans and having bee hives, by enjoying the ""purple glow"" of heather at noon, the sounds of birds' wings, and, of course, the bees. He can even build a cabin and stay on the island much as Thoreau, the American Transcendentalist , lived at Walden Pond. During Yeats's lifetime it was—to his annoyance—one of his most popular poems, and on one occasion was recited (or sung) in his honor by two (or ten—accounts vary) thousand Boy Scouts. [5] The first quatrain speaks to the needs of the body (food and shelter); the second to the needs of the spirit (peace); the final quatrain is the meeting of the inner life (memory) with the physical world (pavement grey).

Were the directors asleep at the wheel? In cahoots with corrupt management teams? Simply incompetent? It seems inconceivable that business disasters of such magnitude could happen without gross or even criminal negligence on the part of board members. And yet a close examination of those boards reveals no broad pattern of incompetence or corruption. In fact, the boards followed most of the accepted standards for board operations: Members showed up for meetings; they had lots of personal money invested in the company; audit committees, compensation committees, and codes of ethics were in place; the boards weren’t too small, too big, too old, or too young. Finally, while some companies have had problems with director independence because of the number of insiders on their boards, this was not true of all the failed boards, and board makeup was generally the same for companies with failed boards and those with well-managed ones.
In other words, they passed the tests that would normally be applied to ascertain whether a board of directors was likely to do a good job. And that’s precisely what’s so scary about these events. Viewing the breakdowns through the lens of my 25 years of experience studying board performance and CEO leadership leads me to one conclusion: It’s time for some fundamentally new thinking about how corporate boards should operate and be evaluated. We need to consider not only how we structure the work of a board but also how we manage the social system a board actually is. We’ll be fighting the wrong war if we simply tighten procedural rules for boards and ignore their more pressing need—to be strong, high-functioning work groups whose members trust and challenge one another and engage directly with senior managers on critical issues facing corporations.
Over time, good-governance advocates have developed no shortage of remedies for failures of governance. Most of these remedies are structural: They’re concerned with rules, procedures, composition of committees, and the like, and together they’re supposed to produce vigilant, involved boards. However, good and bad companies alike have already adopted most of those practices. Let’s take a look at some of the most common.
Regular meeting attendance is considered a hallmark of the conscientious director. It matters a lot and, still, as shareholder activist Nell Minow comments, “Some big names on the boards…barely show up due to other commitments, and when they show, they’re not prepared.” Indeed, some WorldCom directors were on more than ten boards, so how well prepared could they be? Fortune’ s 2001 list of the most-admired U.S. companies reveals no difference in the attendance records of board members of the most- and least-admired companies. Data from the Corporate Library, a corporate governance Web site and database cofounded by Minow, show the same “acceptable” attendance records at both kinds of companies. Good attendance is important for individual board members, but it alone doesn’t seem to have much impact on whether companies are successful.
Board members are assumed to be more vigilant if they hold big chunks of the company’s stock—but data from the Corporate Library don’t suggest that this measure by itself separates good boards from bad, either. Several members of the board of GE, Fortune’ s most-admired corporation in 2001, had less than $100,000 of equity, whereas all board members of the least-admired companies held substantial equity stakes. Not only did all but one of the Enron board members own impressive amounts of equity in the company, but some were still buying as the shares collapsed.
Patrick McGurn of Institutional Shareholder Services, like other expert observers, has frequently questioned the financial literacy of troubled companies’ audit committee members. It’s certainly true that many board members have their jobs because they’re famous, rich, well connected—anything but financially literate. But just as many board members have the training and smarts to detect problems and somehow fail to do their jobs anyway. At the time of their meltdowns, for example, Kmart had six current or recent Fortune 500 CEOs on its board, and Warnaco had several prominent financiers, a well-known retail analyst, and a top-tier CEO; all those excellent credentials made little difference. On this measure, again, we find that Fortune’ s most- and least-admired companies alike had board members with the training and experience to analyze complex financial issues and to understand what kinds of risks a company is taking on.
Despite Enron’s disastrously complex financial schemes, no corporation could have had more appropriate financial competencies and experience on its board. The list includes a former Stanford dean who is an accounting professor, the former CEO of an insurance company, the former CEO of an international bank, a hedge fund manager, a prominent Asian financier, and an economist who is the former head of the U.S. government’s Commodity Futures Trading Commission. Yet members of this board have claimed to have been confused by Enron’s financial transactions.
According to one governance expert, “Enron melted down because it lacks independent directors and several are quite long in the tooth.” His remarks reflect a general belief that boards become less effective as the average age of their members rises. My research on executives over the past two decades has shown that, to the contrary, age is often an asset, and this general finding is supported by board data from the Corporate Library. Charles Schwab, Cisco, and Home Depot all have had several board members who are well into their sixties. Michael Dell (Dell Computer placed tenth on Fortune’ s 2001 list of most-admired companies) told me that when he incorporated in 1987, as a 21-year-old college dropout, he found it invaluable to have then 70-year-old George Kozmetsky, Teledyne’s visionary founder and the former dean of the McCombs School of Business in Austin, Texas, serve on the board; Kozmetsky stayed for more than a decade.
The complicated reality is that sometimes a past CEO’s presence is helpful and sometimes it’s not. In the years I served on and even chaired commissions for the National Association of Corporate Directors (NACD), some commissioners regularly vilified the “old dragons” who haunted successors by serving on boards. In certain cases, this can be a problem; one can only imagine board meetings at Warnaco, where deposed CEO Linda Wachner voted her 9% of the company’s equity for several months after her November 2001 termination. Alternately, a retired CEO can play an invaluable internal role as a mentor, sounding board, and link to critical outside parties. It’s hard to imagine anyone arguing that Intel, Southwest Airlines, or Home Depot would be better off if their legendary retired CEOs Andy Grove, Herb Kelleher, or Bernie Marcus had just gone home to play golf.
Good-governance advocates and stock exchange heavyweights alike have argued that boards with too many insiders are less clean and less accountable. Some argue that Tyco’s confusing spiral of acquisitions and the apparent self-dealing of the CEO at Adelphia Communications might have been less likely if their boards hadn’t been dominated by insiders. Indeed, the New York Stock Exchange’s Corporate Accountability and Standards Committee recently proposed requiring that the majority of a NYSE-listed corporation’s directors be independent—this in response to the recent governance disasters. Governance reform proposals are also being developed by such business groups as the Conference Board and the Business Roundtable. Yet again, if you judge the most- and least-admired companies on Fortune’ s 2001 list against this standard, no meaningful distinction emerges. Least-admired companies like LTV Steel, CKE Restaurants, Kmart, Warnaco, Trump Hotels and Casino Resorts, Federal-Mogul, and US Airways had only one or two inside directors on their boards; Enron had only two. By contrast, at various times in their histories, Home Depot had five insider directors on its 11-person board, Intel had three on a nine-person board, and Southwest Airlines had three on an eight-person board. Typically, half of Microsoft’s board are insiders. Currently, three of Warren Buffett’s seven Berkshire Hathaway board members have the Buffett name, and another is his long-term vice chairman.
United Parcel Service has ranked high on Fortune’ s list of most-admired companies since the list was started, and half of the UPS management committee is on its board. Three outside board members have told me how well plugged-in they have felt over the years because the inside members are very candid and well informed. From what the outside directors have seen, none of the insiders has ever been afraid to debate a point with the boss, the CEO.
A host of other issues that good-governance advocates propose turn out to be either not truly important or already in place at both good and bad companies. Take board size. Small’s considered good, big’s considered bad. But big boards exist at some great and admired companies—GE, Wal-Mart, and Schwab—along with some poorly performing companies like US Airways and AT&T. At the same time, small boards are part of the landscape at good companies like Berkshire Hathaway and Microsoft and some not-so-good companies like Trump.
Another area where good companies don’t necessarily conform to the advice of good-governance advocates: executive sessions, which give boards the chance to evaluate their CEOs without interference. Executive sessions are also sometimes coupled with a designated lead director. But GE, the most-admired company in the country in 2001, didn’t allow executive sessions in Jack Welch’s day. Said Ken Langone, who serves on the boards of both GE and Home Depot, “Jack will give you all the time in the world to raise any issue you want, but he wants to be there during the discussion.” GE’s not alone; many good boards never have meetings that exclude the CEO.
Another supposed safeguard of good governance—audit and compensation committees—turns out to be near universal. A 2001 survey by the NACD and Institutional Shareholder Services of 5,000 public company boards shows that 99% have audit committees, and 91% have compensation committees. Sunbeam, Enron, Cendant, McKessonHBOC, and Waste Management all had the requisite number of committees and guidelines, yet accounting scandals still penetrated this governance shield. Let’s not forget, either, that the audit committee at Enron was consulted about suspending the conflict-of-interest guidelines and willingly agreed to it.
So if following good-governance regulatory recipes doesn’t produce good boards, what does? The key isn’t structural, it’s social. The most involved, diligent, value-adding boards may or may not follow every recommendation in the good-governance handbook. What distinguishes exemplary boards is that they are robust, effective social systems. Let’s see what that means.
What distinguishes exemplary boards is that they are robust, effective social systems.
It’s difficult to tease out the factors that make one group of people an effective team and another, equally talented group of people a dysfunctional one; well-functioning, successful teams usually have chemistry that can’t be quantified. They seem to get into a virtuous cycle in which one good quality builds on another. Team members develop mutual respect; because they respect one another, they develop trust; because they trust one another, they share difficult information; because they all have the same, reasonably complete information, they can challenge one another’s conclusions coherently; because a spirited give-and-take becomes the norm, they learn to adjust their own interpretations in response to intelligent questions.
The UPS board of directors has just that kind of chemistry, and as a result members have debated strategic decisions openly and constructively for years. The company’s 1991 move from Connecticut to Georgia was hotly debated within the management committee, for example, but once the plan to move was agreed upon, the board chose a new location unanimously and never looked back. In the mid-1980s, after forging partnerships with delivery businesses around the world, a revolutionary concept at the time, the company decided to reverse course and become truly global itself. In just two years, UPS was running operations in more countries than are members of the United Nations. This strategic reversal is generally considered a brilliant move, one that might never have happened had board members not respected and trusted one another enough to consider that a smart move could be trumped by an even smarter one. The board even tolerated an open debate in 1992, led by a former CEO, over the company’s widely recognized corporate color, brown—the hallmark of UPS’s current advertising campaign.
A virtuous cycle of respect, trust, and candor can be broken at any point. One of the most common breaks occurs when the CEO doesn’t trust the board enough to share information. What kind of CEO waits until the night before the board meeting to dump on the directors a phone-book-size report that includes, buried in a thicket of subclauses and footnotes, the news that earnings are off for the second consecutive quarter? Surely not a CEO who trusts his or her board. Yet this destructive, dangerous pattern happens all the time. Sometimes a CEO’s lack of trust takes even more dramatic forms. It’s stunning that Enron’s chairman and CEO never told the board that whistle-blower Sherron Watkins had raised major questions about financial irregularities. It is impossible for a board to monitor performance and oversee a company if complete, timely information isn’t available to the board.
It is, I should note, the responsibility of the board to insist that it receive adequate information. The degree to which this doesn’t happen is astonishing. Consider Tyco. In recent quarters, it’s suffered some of the worst strategic confusion I’ve ever witnessed: Seemingly every single public statement by the company’s senior management has been contradicted by subsequent statements. For example, in January 2002, then CEO Dennis Kozlowski announced a plan to split the company into four pieces, only to reverse that plan a few months later. On a single day, senior managers announced first that a financial unit would be IPO’ed, next that it would be sold to an investment house, and finally that neither would occur. Where was the board? Why didn’t directors demand a better accounting of the company’s direction and well-being? What brought down the CEO eventually was an apparently private financial matter—the board seemed content to keep him on indefinitely.
Another sign that trust is lacking is when board members begin to develop back channels to line managers within the company. This can occur because the CEO hasn’t provided sufficient, timely information, but it can also happen because board members are excessively political and are pursuing agendas they don’t want the CEO to know about. If a board is healthy, the CEO provides sufficient information on time and trusts the board not to meddle in day-to-day operations. He or she also gives board members free access to people who can answer their questions, obviating the need for back channels.
Another common point of breakdown occurs when political factions develop on the board. Sometimes this happens because the CEO sees the board as an obstacle to be managed and encourages factions to develop, then plays them against one another. Pan Am founder Juan Trippe was famous for doing this. As early as 1939, the board forced him out of the CEO role, but he found ways to sufficiently terrorize the senior managers at the company and one group of board members that he was returned to office. When he was fired again following huge cost overruns on the Boeing 747 the company underwrote, he coerced the directors into naming a successor who was terminally ill.
Most CEOs aren’t as manipulative as Trippe, and in fact, they’re often frustrated by divisive, seemingly intractable cliques that develop on boards. Failing to neutralize such factions can be fatal. Several members of Jim Robinson’s American Express board were willing to provide the advice, support, and linkage he needed—but the board was also riddled with complex political agendas. Eventually the visionary CEO was pushed out during a business downturn by a former chairman who wanted to reclaim the throne and a former top executive of another company who many felt simply missed the limelight.
The CEO, the chairman, and other board members can take steps to create a climate of respect, trust, and candor. First and most important, CEOs can build trust by distributing reports on time and sharing difficult information openly. In addition, they can break down factions by splitting up political allies when assigning members to activities such as site visits, external meetings, and research projects. It’s also useful to poll individual board members occasionally: An anonymous survey can uncover whether factions are forming or if members are uncomfortable with an autocratic CEO or chairman. Other revelations may include board members’ distrust of outside auditors, internal company reports, or management’s competence. These polls can be administered by outside consultants, the lead director, or professional staff from the company.
Perhaps the most important link in the virtuous cycle is the capacity to challenge one another’s assumptions and beliefs. Respect and trust do not imply endless affability or absence of disagreement. Rather, they imply bonds among board members that are strong enough to withstand clashing viewpoints and challenging questions.
I’m always amazed at how common groupthink is in corporate boardrooms. Directors are, almost without exception, intelligent, accomplished, and comfortable with power. But if you put them into a group that discourages dissent, they nearly always start to conform. The ones that don’t often self-select out. Financier Ken Langone tells the story of a widely admired CEO who was invited to join the board of a famous corporation that is suffering great distress today. He was told that, as a matter of custom, new directors were expected to say nothing for the first 12 months. The candidate said, “Fine, I’ll see you in a year,” and of course never got the appointment. Langone explained that directors generally feel that they are under pressure to fit in so they’ll be renominated. As he put it, “Almost no one wants to be a skunk at a lawn party.”
Good board governance can’t be legislated, but it can be built over time. Your best bets for success: Create a climate of ...
Even a single dissenter can make a huge difference on a board. Bill George, a former CEO and chairman of the board of Medtronic, reported that a lone dissenter had forced his company to reconsider near unanimous decisions on several occasions. One pharmaceutical director held out in opposition to Medtronic’s acquisition of Alza, a maker of drug delivery systems, saying it would take Medtronic into an area it knew nothing about. He was so convincing that the acquisition was abandoned, and in retrospect, that was the right decision. Another dissenter convinced George and the board to reverse themselves and not to get out of the angioplasty business—and, indeed, to intensify those services—and that shift has paid off handsomely.
Frequently, executive recruiters looking for leads during board candidate searches will ask, “Is this fellow a team player?” which is code for “Is this person compliant, or does he make trouble?” If a board member challenges major decisions, a company sometimes goes to great lengths to discredit the person. Consider Walter Hewlett—an academic; the cofounder’s son, who controlled 18% of Hewlett-Packard stock; and someone with a deep understanding of the computer business—who had the temerity to question HP’s proposed merger with Compaq in the fall of 2001. Despite the fact that technology mergers rarely work, his point of view was summarily dismissed internally. When he was forced to go public with his objections, he was ridiculed publicly in a smear campaign.
CEOs who don’t welcome dissent try to pack the court, and the danger of that action is particularly clear right now. Recall that Enron board members Rebecca Mark and Clifford Baxter resigned reportedly because they were uncomfortable with paths the company had taken. And one can imagine a happier ending at Arthur Andersen had somebody said, “Wait a minute,” when the document shredding began, or at Tyco when the board learned of millions in undisclosed loans to the CEO and didn’t question them.
The CEO, the chairman, the lead director, and the board in general need to demonstrate through their actions that they understand the difference between dissent and disloyalty. This distinction cannot be legislated through nominating committee rules and guidelines for director résumés; it has to be something that leaders believe in and model. Home Depot chairman Bernie Marcus notes that, for one simple reason, he’d never serve on a board where dissent was discouraged: When he serves on a board, his reputation and his fortune are on the line. A lost reputation can’t be regained, and director’s insurance won’t necessarily protect anyone’s fortune, because there are always exemption clauses. Marcus has remarked, “I often say, ‘I don’t think you want me on your board. Because I am contentious. I ask a lot of questions and if I don’t get the answers, I won’t sit down.’ That’s the kind of board member that I want on my board…because our company needs help. We think we’re bright, but we’re not the smartest people in the world.” Ken Langone corroborates this view of the Home Depot board. Both he and Marcus describe times when the board disagreed with management about strategic questions—when reformulating the small-store concept, for example, and when revisiting expansion into Latin America. The upshot wasn’t that the board won and management lost, but rather that, after passionate disagreements had been voiced, together they arrived at new conclusions.
According to data complied by Kathleen Eisenhardt and L.J. Bourgeois, the highest-performing companies have extremely contentious boards that regard dissent as an obligation and that treat no subject as undiscussable. Directors at these companies scoff at some of the devices more timid companies use to encourage dissent, such as outside directors asking management to leave while they discuss company performance. What’s the point of criticizing management, they ask, if management isn’t there to answer the criticism? It should be noted that skepticism and dissent don’t constitute disagreement for its own sake but rather are the by-products of a constantly evolving view of the business and of the world.
The highest-performing companies have extremely contentious boards that regard dissent as an obligation and that treat no subject as undiscussable.
When board members don’t challenge one another, individual directors’ roles—the ruthless cost cutter, the damn-the-details big-picture guy, the split-the-differences peacemaker—can become stereotyped or rigid. Effective boards require their members to play a variety of roles, in some cases dipping deep into the details of a particular business, in others playing the devil’s advocate, in still others serving as the project manager. Playing different roles gives directors a wider view of the business and of the alternatives available to it.
Occasionally board members can so thoroughly transcend their normal roles that they’re able to change their minds about something they once built their lives around. This happened at PepsiCo in 1997 when the board decided to sell the various components of its well-run restaurant group. CEO Roger Enrico had previously turned around the unit— which had been the brainchild of two of Enrico’s predecessors, Don Kendall and Wayne Calloway—and must have felt great pride of ownership. Yet he eventually convinced all that the restaurant unit should be sold so that it could flourish freely beyond the controls of the parent company. It’s proved to be a brilliant decision.
Board accountability is a tricky problem for CEOs, as a 2002 survey by the Yale School of Management and the Gallup Organization underscores. In that survey, fully 25% of CEOs claim that their board members do not appreciate the complexity of the businesses they oversee. In addition, we’ve all seen instances when individual responsibility dissolved in large groups. This certainly appears to have happened at Enron: Practically everyone involved has pointed the finger of blame at others or proclaimed his or her ignorance as a badge of honor. The fact that many board members were financially sophisticated seemed to have encouraged the other board members to defer to their expertise.
There are various methods for enforcing accountability. Home Depot’s board members are expected to visit at least eight stores outside their home state between board meetings; GE’s board members dine with the company’s largest suppliers and distributors the night before the annual meeting. Perhaps the most effective enforcement mechanism, though, is old-fashioned peer pressure. Directors who take their duties seriously, and let their fellow directors know they’re expected to do the same, are the best insurance against a board whose first question, upon receipt of the quarterly earnings report, is, “When’s lunch?”
I can’t think of a single work group whose performance gets assessed less rigorously than corporate boards. In 2001, the NACD surveyed 200 CEOs serving as outside directors of public firms. Sixty-three percent said those boards had never been subjected to a performance evaluation. Forty-two percent acknowledged that their own companies had never done a board evaluation. A 2001 Korn/Ferry study of board directors found that only 42% regularly assess board performance, and only 67% regularly evaluate the CEO.
This lack of feedback is self-destructive. Behavioral psychologists and organizational learning experts agree that people and organizations cannot learn without feedback. No matter how good a board is, it’s bound to get better if it’s reviewed intelligently.
A performance review can include a full board evaluation, individual directors’ self-assessments, and directors’ peer reviews of one another. Most often, the nominating or governance committee drives these evaluations. A full board review can include an evaluation of such dimensions as its understanding and development of strategy, its composition, its access to information, and its levels of candor and energy. In individual self-assessments, board members can review the use of their time, the appropriate use of their skills, their knowledge of the company and its industry, their awareness of key personnel, and their general level of preparation.
The peer review can consider the constructive and less constructive roles individual directors play in discussions, the value and use of various board members’ skill sets, interpersonal styles, individuals’ preparedness and availability, and directors’ initiative and links to critical stakeholders. This process is often best driven by a board committee such as a nominating or governance committee, which is assigned the execution and follow-through responsibilities for this process.
Annual evaluations led PepsiCo and Target to change their processes for reviewing strategy with their boards. Instead of the mind-numbing, back-to-back, business-unit dog and pony shows that boards often suffer, each company decided to spend a full day of each board meeting looking in depth at the strategic challenges of a single business unit. • • •
We all owe the shareholder activists, accountants, lawyers, and analysts who study corporate governance a debt: In the 1980s and 1990s, they alerted us to the importance of independent directors, audit committees, ethical guidelines, and other structural elements that can help ensure that a corporate board does its job. Without a doubt, these good-governance guidelines have helped companies avoid problems, big and small. But they’re not the whole story or even the longest chapter in the story. If a board is to truly fulfill its mission—to monitor performance, advise the CEO, and provide connections with a broader world—it must become a robust team—one whose members know how to ferret out the truth, challenge one another, and even have a good fight now and then.

He is eventually caught in the middle of a misunderstanding and is forced to join the Dead Poets Society.",Gale Hansen played Charlie Dalton in Dead Poets Society.,"By Steven Tye / Updated: Jan. 11, 2021 4:24 pm EST
Fueled by poetry and led by an actor known mostly for goofball comedy, Dead Poets Society was an unlikely hit. More than 30 years after its premiere, it remains an inspiration, beloved of fans worldwide.
All the themes of the 1989 classic still ring true today: The beauty of art, the wildness of the teenage spirit, and the cultivation of the urge to seize the day are as relevant to modern viewers as they've ever been. The heavier subject matter also connects with anyone who has ever felt trapped in their life. The cast shines with particular brightness: Here is a film in which every actor is at his best, burning with talent, ambition, and total faith in the material. As a result, one can't help but wonder what happened to the cast who so inspired us to chase our dreams. Some you'll recognize from other movies and TV shows, some stepped back from the limelight, and some ended up taking paths no one could have predicted — but all of them changed us forever with their refusal to let life pass them by.
The bulk of Dead Poets Society's angst comes from its lovable lead, Neil Perry, played by Robert Sean Leonard. Since playing Neil, Leonard's life has been chock-full of work. In 1992, Leonard joined his friend Ethan Hawke and several other actors to form Malaparte , a theater company which ran for several years. He also maintained a large presence in the entertainment world, appearing in dozens of different projects across TV and film since the '90s. There is one role, however, that stands out from the rest.
In 2004, Leonard was cast alongside Hugh Laurie in the iconic television show House . As Dr. James Wilson, Leonard became an essential part of the show dynamic, scoring him nominations for a SAG and a People's Choice award over the course of the series. The versatile actor maintains a large presence in theater as well, winning a Tony Award for his 2001 performance in The Invention of Love .
Despite maintaining a busy work schedule, Leonard keeps himself out of the tabloids and values his privacy. He briefly dated Gwyneth Paltrow in 1994 , and married his wife, Gabriella Salick , in 2008. Today, he balances work with raising two young daughters.
In the final moments of Dead Poets Society , shy Todd Anderson musters up all his courage to stand tall atop his desk in an act of thrilling defiance. It's a triumphant moment that left us all feeling warm inside, thanks to a young Ethan Hawke's skill. One of the most prolific members of the cast, Hawke's post- Poets success is vast and varied.
The young star continued to work throughout the '90s, most notably in 1994's Reality Bites , 1995's Before Sunrise , and 1997's Gattaca . Hawke was nominated for his first Academy Award for 2001's Training Day , and went on to be nominated many more times for acting and writing. You might also recognize Hawke from The Purge and his appearance in the 2016 remake of The Magnificent Seven .
The dashing thespian has four children through two marriages and keeps himself busy with philanthropy and activism when he isn't acting. While he dips his toes into politics should questions arise, he has made it clear that his main focus is on art.
A large chunk of Dead Poets Society 's story is Knox's pursuit of a cheerleader named Kris from a nearby public school. She is spoken for, but the lovestruck teenager persists, implementing his newfound passion for poetry in attempts to win her love. The hopeless romantic is played by Josh Charles, another Poets alumni who has gone on to have great success in the world of entertainment.
You might recognize Charles as the despicable T.J. McCabe in 2003's S.W.A.T. or as the equally deplorable Detective Fowler in 2005's Four Brothers . Despite a few years of being typecast as a villain, the versatile actor has displayed an ability to shift genres by appearing in Wet Hot American Summer: First Day of Camp and Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt . The actor has been nominated for several awards for his role as Will Gardner in The Good Wife and was also nominated for a Critics' Choice Award for a role in Inside Amy Schumer in 2015.
Through the '90s and into the '00s, Charles dated Sheryl Crow , Jennifer Connelly , and Ashley Judd before meeting his wife, ballet dancer and author Sophie Flack . The two married in 2013 and have two children. He maintains an active social media presence on both Twitter and Instagram . By the looks of things, the actor seems to enjoy his life as a father and is soaking it up for all it's worth.
One of the wilder members of the Dead Poets Society is Charlie Dalton, played by Gale Hansen. The student who would become known as Nuwanda is aloof and walks down whichever path he finds most appealing in any given moment. The lovable jester brings a large amount of heat down on the group when he publishes an article demanding girls be admitted into the school. His true virtue shines through when he refuses to give up his friends while being paddled by the headmaster. Charlie might be rebellious, but his soul is brave and strong.
Hansen had a few minor roles through the '90s, including a co-starring role alongside Rob Lowe in The Finest Hour . The actor then stepped behind the scenes and now quietly cultivates projects as a studio executive. Hansen is currently the head of story and development at Fortunate Falls Studios as well as an acting coach in Los Angeles. His active Twitter account gives the clearest glimpse into his current life, one full of passion, politics, and art. Nuwanda lives on.
Throughout all the ups, downs, and desk-standing of Dead Poets Society , quiet, geeky Steven Meeks is reluctant to join the ranks. Eventually he plays along, mostly finding joy in the liveliness of those around him. Throughout most of the film, Meeks is distracted by the custom radio he is building with Gerard Pitts. Judging by a teacher's reaction to its construction, this is a very naughty thing to do that the school seeks to squash. Actor Allelon Ruggiero delightfully portrays the nerdy club member as he experiments with anti-authoritarianism, science, and friendship.
Ruggiero later had small roles in the films 12 Monkeys and Fallen and appeared in an episode of Law & Order before pulling back from acting in 2004 for almost a decade. Most recently, you can see Ruggiero in an episode of Crazy Ex-Girlfriend , as well as the short film Melting Pot and the series Trent & Tilly .
After Neil's demise, the students struggle to process their emotions. Welton Academy looks for a scapegoat to assign the blame to, and the student they choose is Richard Cameron, played by Dylan Kussman. In order to avoid any repercussions, he absolves himself of all responsibility and places the blame solely on their teacher, Mr. Keating. It's hard to blame him entirely — he's a kid thrust into an utterly unfair situation by adults flagrantly abusing their own authority. But still, you just can't help but scowl at the fearful teenager throwing his teacher under the bus.
Dylan Kussman has continued to play small roles over the years, appearing in The X-Files , Nash Bridges , and Monk . The gruff actor also appears in Jack Reacher and in the George Clooney film Leatherheads . In the past decade he has had continued success behind the camera as well. He helped pen 2017's The Mummy with Tom Cruise and wrote, starred in, and directed the critically acclaimed series The Steps . Kussman recently appeared in Richard Jewel and was working on the series Vital Signs starring Dr. Dre until the show was shelved by Apple executives .
Gerard Pitts might have a rather unfortunate name, but he's played by an actor with a much more familiar moniker. James Waterston is the son of legendary actor Sam Waterston — but despite this pedigree, Waterston the younger has maintained a low profile in entertainment through the years. Waterston was part of the Malaparte theater company alongside Ethan Hawke while studying at Yale. He has also appeared on shows such as Law and Order: SVU , ER , and The Blacklist . Moreover, he has enjoyed a solid career upon the stage , and contributes to Providence Magazine .
As far as his personal life goes, Waterston married his wife Line Lillevik in 2000. Most recently he has appeared in the film Human Capital and the Amazon Video original series Modern Love . One thing is made clear by Waterston's colorful biography: Though Gerard Pitts might be one of the quieter members of the Dead Poets Society, his actor leads a life that is anything but unremarkable.
The fight against conformity waged by the Dead Poets Society is opposed by Headmaster Nolan, played by Norman Lloyd. Lloyd portrays Nolan to prickly perfection — which doesn't come as a surprise to anyone familiar with his long career. Lloyd began acting in the 1930s, and has taken things nice and slow since Dead Poets Society . This only stands to reason, since Lloyd is 105 years old. You read that right. Lloyd used to play tennis with Charlie Chaplin , survived the Hollywood blacklist , and watched Babe Ruth play in the 1926 World Series.
Most recently, Lloyd appeared in 2015's Trainwreck and a 2010 episode of Modern Family . He spends most of his time pursuing his love of baseball and mentoring those around him. Those who recognize the knowledge the veteran possesses are blessed with countless stories from his decades of experience, including set stories involving the likes of Alfred Hitchcock and Orson Welles . Indeed, the headmaster of Welton Academy continues to cultivate the younger generation — although his approach is a bit more gentle nowadays.
After being inspired by Professor Keating, Neil Perry discovers his passion for acting. His father, played by Kurtwood Smith, rips apart those dreams, and forces young Neil into a life of study, discipline, and repetition. This stern performance is thanks to the unwavering Smith, who depicts Thomas Perry with ironclad skill. This wonderful character actor has enjoyed a long career in a wide variety of TV shows and movies of every genre stripe.
Smith is likely best known for his performance as Red on That '70s Show . He's also well-known to sci-fi fans — Smith has had a variety of roles across the Star Trek series, The X-Files , and the DC animated universe . Most recently, he appeared on the TV shows Suits and Perfect Harmony . Fans will soon be getting more Smith in a currently untitled Nate Bargatze project. Whatever's in store, it's sure to impeccably portrayed by the wide-ranging actor.
The object of Knox's affections is Chris Noel, played by Alexandra Powers. While Knox's romantic displays may have bordered on obsessive, Powers helped us feel charmed by the innocence of it all. The actress was on a big rise through the '90s, having majors roles in L.A. Law and 21 Jump Street . She also played Tonya Harding in the TV movie, Tonya & Nancy: The Inside Story . She was on the precipice of big things ... until she dropped out of acting completely. To date, her last role was in 2001's Zigs .
What happened? In the late '90s, Powers became a Scientologist and rose through the ranks to become a member of their prestigious Sea Organization. She married her husband Gavin Potter in 2000, and little has been heard from her since. Rumors have proliferated, of course, but with little to fuel them, Powers has only slid farther into obscurity. As she continues to be absent from Hollywood and maintains zero social media presence, that seems unlikely to change any time soon.
The newest teacher at Welton Academy, Professor John Keating was once a student there himself — and he's determined to make sure the boys he teaches leave his classroom stronger, braver, and more creative people. Robin Williams' performance as the kind-hearted, day-seizing teacher remains one of his most beloved roles.
Williams didn't slow down one bit after the film's release. In the ensuing years, he became the Genie in Aladdin , the titular nanny in Mrs. Doubtfire , and Sean Maguire in Good Will Hunting . Though he is best remembered as a comedian, he made waves as a dramatic performer time and time again. Williams was never content to do any one thing — for every family-friendly film in his body of work, a la Ferngully , there is a bizarre psychological thriller like One Hour Photo . His death in 2014 at the age of 63 was mourned worldwide: The lights of Broadway were darkened , President Barack Obama made a statement , and spontaneous memorials popped up throughout the world. Williams might not be with us anymore, but the spirit of his work lives on, inspiring us in much the same way Professor Keating inspired his students.",source_text/4629b06514d7e925be7a3387150b19099659bafcd96a9e864772a2576ea07bfc-neeva_0_0.txt,"One of the wilder members of the Dead Poets Society is Charlie Dalton, played by Gale Hansen.",complete_support,False,song - sang - wrote - sings - movie - played - plays - blood - released - original,StanfordCitation,0.88,0.61,0.48,0.47,[0.9992141723632812],[0.9992141723632812]

So, twelve years on from the film’s original release, and to tie in with its UK debut on Blu-ray, we ask, where are the voices behind A Bug’s Life now, and what have they done since?
Dave Foley – Flik
One of the former members of The Kids In The Hall and a stand-up comedian, Dave Foley has been well occupied since providing the voice for Flik. He’s either providing voice talent for animated TV shows, or appearing in person as in a stint on Will And Grace , and the mini-series Kids In The Hall: Death Comes To Town.

Kevin Spacey – Hopper
When he’s not promoting Virgin Airways, Kevin Spacey’s usually following his other interests in being an actor, writer, director, producer and musical performer. He’s also the artistic director of the Old Vic, a position he took up in 2003 and promised to hold for at least ten years.
In 2006, he made it known that he intends to take UK citizenship, having lived here for some time.
Julia Louis-Dreyfus – Atta

The career of Julia Louis-Dreyfus has been action packed, after she first gained notoriety on Saturday Night Live in the mi-80s. A Bug’s Life came at the end of appearing in 173 episodes of Seinfeld , although she had done plenty of voice work previously. Since then, she’s been in Curb Your Enthusiasm, The Simpsons , was the lead actor in The New Adventures Of Old Christine , and most recently appeared in 30 Rock .

A unique performer, Phyllis Diller first appeared on screen in 1961, when she was then 44. That makes her 93, and she’s still going strong. Since Bug’s , she’s been in a soap, T he Bold And The Beautiful , provided voice talent for Family Guy, The Powerpuff Girls and The Adventures Of Jimmy Neutron: Boy Genius , among others.
Richard Kind – Molt
Possibly one of the most prolific actors in Hollywood today, Richard Kind’s a regular animation voice talent and a staple of both TV and film. The list of things he’s done since A Bug’s Life is vast, but includes TV appearances on Leverage, Burn Notice, Curb Your Enthusiasm, Two And A Half Men, Stargate: Atlantis and Scrubs . He’s also done lots of voice work, and even got to be the Bookworm in Toy Story 3.
David Hyde Pierce – Slim

David Hyde Pierce is perhaps best known for being Frasier’s brother, Dr. Niles Crane, something he was doing before working with Pixar and returned to for a further six years after completing A Bug’s Life . He’s since almost exclusively moved into voiceover work, including The Simpsons , and Abe Sapien in Hellboy . This year, he returned to film acting, appearing as Warwick Wilson in the thriller The Perfect Host. Joe Ranft – Heimlich
Sadly, Joe Ranft died in 2005 at the age of just 45, from injuries sustained in a road accident. His career to that point was extraordinary, having written the stories for Oliver & Company, Beauty And The Beast , and The Lion King , and worked with John Lasseter and Andrew Stanton to create A Bug’s Life . Ranft was also a sketch artist and story supervisor before becoming a regular voice talent.
He was the voice of Lenny the Binoculars in the first Toy Story movie, was Wheezy in the second and contributed to Monsters, Inc., Finding Nemo, The Incredibles and Cars . Tim Burton’s Corpse Bride was one of his last projects and that film is dedicated to his memory.
Denis Leary – Francis

A hugely well-known stand-up comedian and actor before working with Pixar, he’s since got his own animation franchise as Diego in the Ice Age movies. He has also moved into writing, as in his serious long-running TV series, Rescue Me . He’s recently been connected with the Spider-Man reboot, playing Gwen Stacy’s father.
Jonathan Harris – Manny
The unmistakable Jonathan Harris is well remembered for playing the conniving Dr. Smith in the original Lost In Space TV series. For geeks, he’ll also be remembered as the voice of the Cylon Lucifer in the original Battlestar Galactica TV series.
After playing Manny, he worked again for Pixar as Geri the Cleaner in Toy Story 2 .
In 2002, Jonathan Harris sadly passed away just a few days before his 88th birthday.

Madeline Kahn – Gypsy Moth
In a stunning career that encompassed stage, TV and film, A Bug’s Life was one of Madeline Kahn’s last productions, although she managed to fit this in between the 60 episodes of The Cosby Show she appeared in between 1996 and 1999. She died just a year after A Bug’s Life , at the age of just 57.
I’ll always remember her for the wonderfully absurd characters she played in Mel Brookes’ movies, such as Lili Von Shtupp in Blazing Saddles.
Bonnie Hunt – Rosie

An amazingly talented person, Bonnie Hunt is an actress, writer, producer and director, and has appeared in such diverse productions as Jerry Maguire, The Green Mile and Cheaper By The Dozen and its sequel.
She went to Pixar having produced her own talk show, The Bonnie Hunt Show , which has since returned, now approaching its 300th episode. She still works for Pixar on occasion, providing voice work for Monsters, Inc., Cars (and soon Cars 2 ), and Toy Story 3 . Michael McShane – Tuck and Roll
Connecting many dots here, Michael McShane appeared on Frasier, and Seinfeld , but is best known in the UK for his amazing contributions to Whose Line Is It Anyway?
Since working with Pixar, he’s split his time between animated voice work, cameo TV show appearances and stage work. John Ratzenberger – P.T. Flea

A hardy perennial at Pixar, he’s provided the Hamm voice for all the Toy Story movies, and the Abominable Snowman for Monsters, Inc. He’s also in Finding Nemo, The Incredibles (he’s the Underminer at the end), Cars and its sequel, Ratatouille, WALL-E and Up . He does make the occasional TV and film appearance away from Pixar (and Cheers fans will recognise him as Cliff Clavin), but he’s best known these days for his dry and resonating voice. Brad Garrett – Dim
Another actor who, once he’d worked with Pixar, returned multiple times for its productions. He provided the voice of Dim while in the middle of a 208 episode run of Everyone Loves Raymond , where he played Robert Barone. But he’d done plenty of voice work before, including Transformers , and Biker Mice From Mars .
Since A Bug’s Life , he’s returned to Pixar to be Bloat in Finding Nemo , and voiced Chef Gusteau for Ratatouille . He’s also in Disney’s Tangled , while since 2006 he’s been the lead character in US TV comedy Til Death.
A Bug’s Life is available on Blu-ray now.

Under this grant of authority, Congress enacted the ""Bankruptcy Code"" in 1978. The Bankruptcy Code, which is codified as title 11 of the United States Code, has been amended several times since its enactment. It is the uniform federal law that governs all bankruptcy cases.
The procedural aspects of the bankruptcy process are governed by the Federal Rules of Bankruptcy Procedure (often called the ""Bankruptcy Rules"") and local rules of each bankruptcy court. The Bankruptcy Rules contain a set of official forms for use in bankruptcy cases. The Bankruptcy Code and Bankruptcy Rules (and local rules) set forth the formal legal procedures for dealing with the debt problems of individuals and businesses.
There is a bankruptcy court for each judicial district in the country. Each state has one or more districts. There are 90 bankruptcy districts across the country. The bankruptcy courts generally have their own clerk's offices.
The court official with decision-making power over federal bankruptcy cases is the United States bankruptcy judge, a judicial officer of the United States district court. The bankruptcy judge may decide any matter connected with a bankruptcy case, such as eligibility to file or whether a debtor should receive a discharge of debts. Much of the bankruptcy process is administrative, however, and is conducted away from the courthouse. In cases under chapters 7, 12, or 13, and sometimes in chapter 11 cases, this administrative process is carried out by a trustee who is appointed to oversee the case.
A debtor's involvement with the bankruptcy judge is usually very limited. A typical chapter 7 debtor will not appear in court and will not see the bankruptcy judge unless an objection is raised in the case. A chapter 13 debtor may only have to appear before the bankruptcy judge at a plan confirmation hearing. Usually, the only formal proceeding at which a debtor must appear is the meeting of creditors, which is usually held at the offices of the U.S. trustee. This meeting is informally called a ""341 meeting"" because section 341 of the Bankruptcy Code requires that the debtor attend this meeting so that creditors can question the debtor about debts and property.
A fundamental goal of the federal bankruptcy laws enacted by Congress is to give debtors a financial ""fresh start"" from burdensome debts. The Supreme Court made this point about the purpose of the bankruptcy law in a 1934 decision:
[I]t gives to the honest but unfortunate debtor…a new opportunity in life and a clear field for future effort, unhampered by the pressure and discouragement of preexisting debt.
Local Loan Co. v. Hunt , 292 U.S. 234, 244 (1934). This goal is accomplished through the bankruptcy discharge, which releases debtors from personal liability from specific debts and prohibits creditors from ever taking any action against the debtor to collect those debts. This publication describes the bankruptcy discharge in a question and answer format, discussing the timing of the discharge, the scope of the discharge (what debts are discharged and what debts are not discharged), objections to discharge, and revocation of the discharge. It also describes what a debtor can do if a creditor attempts to collect a discharged debt after the bankruptcy case is concluded.
Six basic types of bankruptcy cases are provided for under the Bankruptcy Code, each of which is discussed in this publication. The cases are traditionally given the names of the chapters that describe them.
Chapter 7 , entitled Liquidation, contemplates an orderly, court-supervised procedure by which a trustee takes over the assets of the debtor's estate, reduces them to cash, and makes distributions to creditors, subject to the debtor's right to retain certain exempt property and the rights of secured creditors. Because there is usually little or no nonexempt property in most chapter 7 cases, there may not be an actual liquidation of the debtor's assets. These cases are called ""no-asset cases."" A creditor holding an unsecured claim will get a distribution from the bankruptcy estate only if the case is an asset case and the creditor files a proof of claim with the bankruptcy court. In most chapter 7 cases, if the debtor is an individual, he or she receives a discharge that releases him or her from personal liability for certain dischargeable debts. The debtor normally receives a discharge just a few months after the petition is filed. Amendments to the Bankruptcy Code enacted in to the Bankruptcy Abuse Prevention and Consumer Protection Act of 2005 require the application of a ""means test"" to determine whether individual consumer debtors qualify for relief under chapter 7. If such a debtor's income is in excess of certain thresholds, the debtor may not be eligible for chapter 7 relief.
Chapter 9 , entitled Adjustment of Debts of a Municipality, provides essentially for reorganization, much like a reorganization under chapter 11. Only a ""municipality"" may file under chapter 9, which includes cities and towns, as well as villages, counties, taxing districts, municipal utilities, and school districts.
Chapter 11 , entitled Reorganization, ordinarily is used by commercial enterprises that desire to continue operating a business and repay creditors concurrently through a court-approved plan of reorganization. The chapter 11 debtor usually has the exclusive right to file a plan of reorganization for the first 120 days after it files the case and must provide creditors with a disclosure statement containing information adequate to enable creditors to evaluate the plan. The court ultimately approves (confirms) or disapproves the plan of reorganization. Under the confirmed plan, the debtor can reduce its debts by repaying a portion of its obligations and discharging others. The debtor can also terminate burdensome contracts and leases, recover assets, and rescale its operations in order to return to profitability. Under chapter 11, the debtor normally goes through a period of consolidation and emerges with a reduced debt load and a reorganized business.
Chapter 12 , entitled Adjustment of Debts of a Family Farmer or Fisherman with Regular Annual Income, provides debt relief to family farmers and fishermen with regular income. The process under chapter 12 is very similar to that of chapter 13, under which the debtor proposes a plan to repay debts over a period of time – no more than three years unless the court approves a longer period, not exceeding five years. There is also a trustee in every chapter 12 case whose duties are very similar to those of a chapter 13 trustee. The chapter 12 trustee's disbursement of payments to creditors under a confirmed plan parallels the procedure under chapter 13. Chapter 12 allows a family farmer or fisherman to continue to operate the business while the plan is being carried out.
Chapter 13 , entitled Adjustment of Debts of an Individual With Regular Income, is designed for an individual debtor who has a regular source of income. Chapter 13 is often preferable to chapter 7 because it enables the debtor to keep a valuable asset, such as a house, and because it allows the debtor to propose a ""plan"" to repay creditors over time – usually three to five years. Chapter 13 is also used by consumer debtors who do not qualify for chapter 7 relief under the means test. At a confirmation hearing, the court either approves or disapproves the debtor's repayment plan, depending on whether it meets the Bankruptcy Code's requirements for confirmation. Chapter 13 is very different from chapter 7 since the chapter 13 debtor usually remains in possession of the property of the estate and makes payments to creditors, through the trustee, based on the debtor's anticipated income over the life of the plan. Unlike chapter 7, the debtor does not receive an immediate discharge of debts. The debtor must complete the payments required under the plan before the discharge is received. The debtor is protected from lawsuits, garnishments, and other creditor actions while the plan is in effect. The discharge is also somewhat broader (i.e., more debts are eliminated) under chapter 13 than the discharge under chapter 7.
The purpose of Chapter 15 , entitled Ancillary and Other Cross-Border Cases, is to provide an effective mechanism for dealing with cases of cross-border insolvency. This publication discusses the applicability of Chapter 15 where a debtor or its property is subject to the laws of the United States and one or more foreign countries.
In addition to the basic types of bankruptcy cases, Bankruptcy Basics provides an overview of the Servicemembers' Civil Relief Act, which, among other things, provides protection to members of the military against the entry of default judgments and gives the court the ability to stay proceedings against military debtors.
This publication also contains a description of liquidation proceedings under the Securities Investor Protection Act (""SIPA""). Although the Bankruptcy Code provides for a stockbroker liquidation proceeding, it is far more likely that a failing brokerage firm will find itself involved in a SIPA proceeding. The purpose of SIPA is to return to investors securities and cash left with failed brokerages. Since being established by Congress in 1970, the Securities Investor Protection Corporation has protected investors who deposit stocks and bonds with brokerage firms by ensuring that every customer's property is protected, up to $500,000 per customer.
The bankruptcy process is complex and relies on legal concepts like the ""automatic stay,"" ""discharge,"" ""exemptions,"" and ""assume.""

As water flows around these curves, the outer edge of water is moving faster than the inner. This creates an erosional surface on the outer edge (a cut bank ) and a depostional surface on the inner edge (a point bar ). Where the bends of two meanders meet, they bypass the curve of river, creating an oxbow lake which may then be infilled with overwash sediment.
Meanders change position by eroding sideways and slightly downstream. The sideways movement occurs because the maximum velocity of the stream shifts toward the outside of the bend, causing erosion of the outer bank. At the same time the reduced current at the inside of the meander results in the deposition of coarse sediment, especially sand. Thus by eroding its outer bank and depositing material along its inner bank, a stream moves sideways without changing its channel size. Due to the slope of the channel, erosion is more effective on the downstream side of a meander. Therefore, in addition to growing laterally, the bends also gradually migrate down the valley.

Is there anything else you would like to know?","Field Marshal Sam Hormusji Framji Jamshedji Manekshaw, widely known as Sam Manekshaw and Sam Bahadur, was the Chief of the Indian Army during the 1971 Indo-Pak war.","The military confrontation between India and Pakistan in 1971 led to the birth of yet another country named Bangladesh. Fifty years ago, the Indian troops returned home victorious on December 16, 1971. Pakistan began the war with operation Chengiz Khan, which included airstrikes on 11 air force stations on the Indian side, after which then Prime Minister Indira Gandhi declared war. After 13 days into the war, the Indian military had the upper hand, and the Eastern Command of Pakistan signed the famous instrument of surrender, which transformed East Pakistan into Bangladesh. The Indian Army had taken more than 93,000 Pakistan troops as Prisoners of War after India emerged victoriously.
Field Marshal Sam Hormusji Framji Jamshedji Manekshaw, a Mahavir Chakra awardee widely known as Sam Manekshaw and Sam Bahadur, was the Chief of the Indian Army during the 1971 Indo-Pak war. In April 1971, when Prime Minister Indira Gandhi asked him if he was ready for a war, he straight-forwardly replied that most of his armoured and infantry units were deployed elsewhere, and only 12 of his tanks were prepared for the combat. Moreover, he highlighted that the Himalayan passes would reopen, and the region would be flooded. He asked the Prime Minister of India could win the war if she let him plan independently and lead the war, and she agreed.
He sent radio messages to the Pakistani troops three times before their surrender. In his message on December 9, the General said, ""Indian forces have surrounded you. Your Air Force is destroyed. You have no hope of any help from them. Chittagong, Chalna and Mangla ports are blocked. Nobody can reach you from the sea. Your fate is sealed. The Mukti Bahini and the people are all prepared to take revenge for the atrocities and cruelties you have committed...Why waste lives? Don't you want to go home and be with your children? Do not lose time; there is no disgrace in laying down your arms to a soldier. We will give you the treatment befitting a soldier"". The surrender happened at 3:00 PM on December 16, 1971. Two years later, in 1973, General Sam Manekshaw became the first Indian soldier to be promoted to the rank of Field Marshal.
During the 1971 war, another notable Indian Soldier was Lt General JFR Jacob, who served as the Major General of the Eastern Command. In his 36-year-old military career, the officer had already fought two wars, namely, the second world war and the Indo-Pak conflict of 1965. General Jacob served as the Chief of Staff for the Eastern Command and was awarded merit for his role in the Bangladesh Liberation war.

The General disagreed with several senior officials and said that his 'war of movement' plan aimed to take control of all of East Pakistan. General Jacob understood that a protracted war would not be in India's best interests. On December 16, during a lull in the battle, Jacob sought permission to visit Niazi to seek his surrender, and he flew to Dhaka and obtained an unconditional surrender from Niazi. After he retired from the Indian Army in 1978, Lt Gen JFR Jacob served as the governor of Punjab and Goa.
Lt General Jagjit Singh Arora was the General Officer Commanding-In-Chief (GOC) of the Eastern Command of the Indian Army during the 1971 war. The General was responsible for organizing and leading the ground forces in the 1971 war, which led to the overwhelming defeat of the Pakistani Army. As the General commanding the Indian and Bangladesh Forces in the Eastern theatre, Gen Aurora received the surrender from the Governor of East Pakistan and Commander of the Eastern Command of the Pakistan Army, Lt Gen A. A. K. Niazi.
At the outbreak of the war on December 3, 1971, General Arora oversaw the battle in East Pakistan. Forces under the General's command organized themselves in several small units. They organized a four-front attack to confront and defeat the Pakistani Forces on the selected fronts while defeating them on other fronts. In 14 days, his troops advanced from the Indian border towards Dhaka, the capital of East Pakistan. All the 93,000 Pakistani soldiers, more than 80,000 were uniformed personnel, surrendered to General Arora. The other 13,000 included civilians or locals who had pledged their allegiance to Pakistan or families of those in the Army.

One of the many Indian soldiers who played an instrumental role in the 1971 war was Major General Sujan Singh Uban, who laid the foundation of India's 'fifth army'. This Army, named Special Frontier Force (SFF), primarily comprised Tibetan refugees or the Tibetan resistance fighters in India. The primary task of SFF is a defence against the People's Liberation Army (PLA) Ground Force and conducting covert intelligence gathering and commando operations along the Chinese border. The SFF is also known as 'Establishment 22' or just '22' due to its first Inspector General, Maj. During World War II, Gen. Sujan Singh Uban commanded the 22nd Mountain Regiment, Royal Indian Artillery. The SFF was a part of primary combat operations of the Indian side in the war.
The SFF was ordered to attack the Chittagong hills since cross-border attacks increased. The Inspector General also urged that the SFF capture the second-largest city, Chittagong. Still, the idea was not favourable to New Delhi military planners since the unit lacked artillery or airlift support capabilities to conduct a mission of such magnitude.

No government regulations prevent advertisers from showing people drinking beer on television, although most producers avoid it. The traditional industry guidelines that recommend against showing alcohol consumption in commercials date back to the end of prohibition. Still, Congress has not enacted any laws to regulate the use of alcohol in the media.
Read on to learn more about alcohol use in TV and movies and advertisers’ guidelines when airing commercials for beer and other alcohol.
Topics We Cover
Beer commercials have a long history, stretching back all the way back to the adoption of television sets into American homes. Back then, drinking on air was seen as a major faux pas for a nation recently emerging from prohibition, so many advertisers refused to show drinking in their commercials to avoid a moral backlash from viewers .
And in fact, this tradition has carried on to the present day: television agencies continue to advise advertisers against showing people drinking beer in commercials, but apart from banning outright fraud, there are almost no legal restrictions on what can and can’t be shown on television advertisements.
Agencies like the Beer Institute offer marketing codes that prohibit false or misleading advertising and call on advertisers to support:
- Responsible marketing communications
- Responsible alcohol consumption
- Health and Safety
- Protection of Minors
- Alcoholism Awareness
But at the end of the day, these codes are entirely voluntary . So while it might not go over well with the general public, there is really nothing stopping someone from airing a commercial that featured actors consuming alcohol on screen.
The Federal Communications Commission has very little to say regarding alcohol use on TV . According to the agency’s website :
“C ongress has not enacted any law prohibiting broadcast advertising of any kind of alcoholic beverage, and the FCC does not have a rule or policy regulating these advertisements.”
The Federal Trade Commission goes into further detail, explaining that the First Amendment’s protections for free speech limit the government’s ability to regulate alcohol advertisement. The US government has no legal authority over truthful advertising. The FTC has had to rely on the alcohol industry and advertising agencies to self-regulate.
No laws are preventing private citizens from drinking on live TV. Still, just as with advertising, many television agencies show a lot of restraint when drinking on air because of their sensitivity to public perception.
These sensitivities haven’t stopped late-night hosts like Stephen Colbert from sharing a beer with guests during live broadcasts for adult audiences.
It is entirely legal to show people drinking beer on broadcast television . In fact, an estimated 53% of TV programming shows alcohol use.
Movie producers are well within their rights to portray actors consuming alcohol in film. In fact, alcohol use is even more common in theaters than on television. According to research published in the Journal of Health Communication , 89.6% of films contained some form of alcohol use, and 62.6% of films specifically showed actors drinking beer.
What about movies rated G or PG?
The Motion Picture Association of America (MPAA) created our modern film rating system in 1968 to help viewers understand what kind of content to expect in a given film, specifically regarding language, nudity, sex, violence, or content that would offend parents for viewing by children.
Yet even though viewing alcohol use on-screen has been empirically linked to underage drinking , the MPAA rating guidelines do not consider alcohol use to be inappropriate content. On average, 32 seconds of G-rated movies and 122 seconds of PG movies highlight alcohol consumption on screen . So even though there is less alcohol consumption in G and PG movies than PG-13 or R-rated movies, the lack of specific guidelines means that producers are free to include alcohol use in movies for all audiences.
So if the US government relies on advertisement agencies to self-regulate, the question becomes: does self-regulation work?
Multiple peer-reviewed articles published between 2005 and 2013 show that alcohol advertisements regularly breach voluntary restrictions developed by advertising agencies. Depending on the study, anywhere from 35% to 100% of alcohol advertisements have been identified as breaking advertising codes. Common complaints include:
- Unrealistic advertising associating drinking with social success
- Content targeting underage drinkers
- Encouraging sexual activity
- Implied illegal activity
- Sexism and other offensive content
According to government analysis, 24% of alcohol advertisements were more likely to be seen by underage youth than adults of legal drinking age.
Though the government has no authority to regulate advertising due to first amendment protections, there are a few ways that lawmakers and marketing agencies could work together to help encourage more consistent self-regulation.
Here are some proposals based on some successful regulation campaigns in other industries:
Even though the government has no legal jurisdiction over advertisers, a set of consistent guidelines could help advertising agencies identify harmful content.
The label “Organic” was historically unregulated until 1990 when the USDA defined the term to encourage sustainable food systems. There is plenty of room for similar seals of approval in the advertising industry, especially for potentially harmful products like alcohol.
While marketing agencies have leaped forward to define advertising codes, they have done very little to actually enforce their recommendations. By developing p enalties for rule-breakers, these organizations could legitimize their standards in the public eye.
Alcohol marketing is a complicated business, but it is clear that advertisers are willing to follow the industry when it comes to drinking beer in commercials. Since few brands are willing to challenge this seemingly innocuous tradition, there is clearly hope for the industry to enforce a ban on advertisements targeting children with or adults at risk for alcoholism.

Vin Diesel's character, Dom, drove many iconic cars in the Fast & Furious franchise. Here's everything he got behind the wheel of in The Fast Saga.
Dominic Toretto (Vin Diesel) was behind many wheels across the Fast & Furious movies, and among all the cars Dom drives in Fast and Furious sit some of the best and most expensive in the franchise. Every car Dom drove in Fast and Furious is a powerful beast that reflects the protagonist's personality, serving as an extension of the character's onscreen presence. Dominic Toretto has appeared in eight Fast & Furious movies, as well as Diesel's self-created and directed tie-in short film, Los Bandoleros . The actor will surely add a few more vehicles to this list with Fast X on the way.
Dom is a major fan of muscle cars, something that became apparent very early in the franchise. Rather than use typical models for speed during street races, Dom preferred something with horsepower. His love for this type of car was influenced by Dom's father, another car fanatic, and Dom had a tendency to argue with Brian O'Conner over his friend's loyalty to imports. Most recently, Dom appeared in a central role in the F9 cast . Dom will surely get behind the wheel of some more vehicles in the final two installments of Fast & Furious . Until then, here's every car Dom drives in Fast and Furious .
What is the black car Dom drove in Fast and Furious ' early movies? Dom's signature car in The Fast Saga is the black 1970 Dodge Charger R/T. Built by Dom and his father, it appeared in The Fast and the Furious , Fast & Furious , Fast Five , and Furious 7 - where it was destroyed when Dom faced off against Deckard Shaw in LA. Based on how the 1970 Dodge Charger R/T looks at the hideout in F9 , it seems Dom repaired the car after Furious 7 .
One of the most recognizable out of all the cars Dom drives in Fast and Furious , the 1970 Dodge Charger R/T was a part of the second generation of cars, but featured a completely unique style from previous iterations. Equipped with one of the biggest motors Dodge had in production at the time, the R/T was the first to give the option of an installed 440 six-pack, which pushed out a whopping 375 horsepower and 490 pound-feet of torque. A cross between a luxury vehicle and a muscle car, the Charger remains in the annals of most coveted muscle cars of all time.
Not to be outdone by the other cars Dom drives in Fast and Furious , the end credits of The Fast and the Furious shows Dom escaping Los Angeles and driving a red Chevelle in Baja, Mexico. The car then returned in Fast & Furious when Dom drove home to attend Letty's funeral. Dom later sanded the car, repainted it gray, and blew it up while trying to get vengeance for Letty's ""death"" and then her subsequent resurrection several sequels later.
The 1970 Chevrolet Chevelle SS had the option of four different engine styles, with the 454 (LS6) maxing out at a staggering 450 horsepower. Coming in a wide variety of paint colors, 15 in total, the LS6 454 was the third-fastest classic muscle car from the muscle car era and the 2nd fastest overall in 1970. It also featured the highest advertised horsepower at the time and has surpassed its retail value. If one wanted to purchase a 1970 Chevrolet Chevelle SS today, one would have to shell out over $99,000 for the desirable Sport Coupe LS6 454.
Dom's Road Runner was first seen at the end of The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift when he encountered Sean at the race. He mentioned that he got the car from Han, which led back to Furious 7 when Dom traveled to Tokyo to retrieve Han's belongings after his presumed death. Of course, Han's death was faked by him and Mr. Nobody , returning for F9 . Dom used a different Road Runner in the movie when he was back in Los Angeles.
Out of all the cars Dom drives in Fast and Furious , the Plymouth Road Runner was the most revolutionary of the muscle car era. While other muscle cars hiked up their price tags and beefed up their size, the Road Runner did the opposite. Not only does it get its name from a famous cartoon character, but each Road Runner was equipped with a special horn to mimic the character. This stripped-down and basic muscle car, when equipped with a 426-ci Street Hemi, reached a shocking 494 horsepower, living up to its iconic namesake.
Dom bought the Challenger in Spain and was later seen racing Brian at the end of Fast Five while celebrating their successful heist. In the next film, Fast & Furious 6 , Dom and Brian were racing once again while using the same two cars. The fate of the car is currently unknown in The Fast Saga .
Out of all the cars Dom drives in Fast and Furious , the 2009 Dodge Challenger SRT-8 is the newest. Running on a V-8 engine, the Challenger reaches a max horsepower of 425 with 420 pound-feet of torque. Its retro styling is reminiscent of the muscle car era, to be sure, and features a lower suspension for expert handling.
Dom first used the 1968 Dodge Charger Hellacious in F9 when the group arrived in Edinburgh to hunt down Jakob Toretto to stop him from using the Project Ares device. The car was then used during the convoy sequence in Tbilisi, specifically in taking down the armored vehicle with magnets. The Charger was then given to Jakob Toretto, who later attempted to return it to Dom as the brothers made amends.
Out of all the cars Dom drives in Fast and Furious , the 1968 Dodge Charger Hellacious is by far the fastest. Custom-built by Speedkore, a supercharged 6.2-liter Hellcat HEMI V8 is what gives the vehicle a staggering 707 horsepower and 650 pound-foot of torque. The car also features a gated-manual Graziano transaxle from a Lamborghini Gallardo and also has a hydraulic handbrake to help deal with drifts and slides.

It could also push back against voter suppression and tear down barriers to participation. Requiring citizens to vote could also underscore the right to vote as a civic duty.,Requiring citizens to vote could also underscore the right to vote as a civic duty.,"The United States should require all of its citizens to vote. Doing so will push back against voter suppression and tear down barriers to participation because the best way to protect the right to vote is to underscore that it is also a civic duty .
This is the message of a report issued this week by the Universal Voting Working Group, a joint initiative by the Brookings Institution and the Ash Center for Democratic Governance and Innovation at Harvard’s Kennedy School. Its opening words:
“Imagine an American democracy remade by its citizens in the very image of its promise, a society where the election system is designed to allow citizens to perform their most basic civic duty with ease. Imagine that all could vote without obstruction or suppression. Imagine Americans who now solemnly accept their responsibilities to sit on juries and to defend our country in a time of war taking their obligations to the work of self-government just as seriously.”
We argue that the United States should require citizens to participate in elections as Australia and two dozen other nations do. As it is with jury service, so it is with voting: Asserting a civic duty is the best way to guarantee the right this duty entails. Our report, “ Lift Every Voice: The Urgency of Universal Civic Duty Voting ,” aims to build on the achievements of the civil rights, voting rights and democracy movements by continuing to push for a series of reforms to ease access to the ballot box and make voting simpler and easier.
Our working group was under no illusions that mandatory participation in elections would be adopted quickly or easily in the United States. Between now and November 2020, there is much that needs to be done simply to ensure that voters will be able to cast ballots safely. For the medium term, we urge that the first steps toward universal civic duty voting might begin with local or state experiments of the sort that have, in our nation’s past, pushed good ideas to the national stage.
But we also hope to shake up the nation’s voting debate to lay out an expansive vision of what our democracy could and should look like, and to show that this idea, which has only rarely entered the American debate, is exceedingly practical. Australia has had mandatory participation on the books for nearly a century, and it has worked.
Over the course of 18 months, our working group studied systems of universal voting, met with civil rights, voting rights and democracy advocates, immigrant rights groups, state legislative organizations, election officials at all levels, and many others to refine our ideas and create a detailed policy proposal.
Our intervention reflects a sense of alarm and moral urgency, but also a spirit of hope and patriotism. That we consider 50% turnout in midterm elections a historical achievement (as was the case in 2018) should be a warning. The disparities in turnout between different groups, detailed in our report, are equally worrying. Boosting turnout, we insist, is a matter of justice and representation. This mandate also takes seriously the Declaration of Independence’s insistence that political legitimacy depends on the “consent of the governed.” Our turnout levels, at 60 percent on the high end in presidential elections and 40 percent in the typical case in midterm elections, means that elected leaders earn their legitimacy from a small group of individuals even in landslide elections. This suggests that many voters are withholding their consent from our government, passively in some cases and actively by the most alienated voters.
Civic duty voting shifts elections from an “opt-in” to an “opt-out” system. It does not force voters to elect any one candidate and therefore, we believe, it survives constitutional muster. In addition to allowing for a wide variety of exceptions to the voting mandate, the policy laid out in the report also encourages None of the Above options to be added to the ballot. Any civic duty voting policy should allow for religious and conscientious objection to voting.
Casting a ballot in countries with civic duty voting is often easier than it is in the United States. Registering to vote is a straightforward and accessible process, if not automatic; requesting a ballot or finding your polling place typically does not require calls to your local supervisor of elections or constantly checking online resources to ensure that your polling location has not changed; and voting in person does not mean standing in line for hours.
Many opponents of compulsory participation worry about imposing penalties on non-voters. We are careful to insist that fines for non-voting not be more than $20, that neither civil nor criminal penalties would be imposed for not paying the fine, that the amount would not compound over time, and that it would be set aside for those willing to meet a modest community service requirement. Included in the proposal is a conscientious objector provision for those who have religious or moral qualms about voting, and provide a wide range of legitimate reasons voters could give to escape any penalties. In Australia, only 13 percent of non-voters ever have to pay the penalty. Our emphasis is not on imposing sanctions but on sending a strong message that voting is a legitimate expectation of citizenship in a nation dedicated to democratic self-rule.
At a time when our nation is in the midst of a new struggle to end entrenched racial injustice, we see universal voting as a way to amplify long-suppressed voices. The John Lewis, whose loss we mourn and whose life we celebrate, risked his life again and again on behalf of voting rights and full participation. “Voting access is the key to equality in our democracy, Lewis declared. “The size of your wallet, the number on your Zip Code shouldn’t matter. The action of government affects every American so every citizen should have an equal voice.”
Our proposal is rooted in the obligation of all citizens to our democracy and represents an effort to make our system more equal and more participatory. We hope it can serve as a spur for a new and more vibrant democracy.",source_text/a2622ee2c6bcfdf2e37ce2b405be37c5994d158c69113582da9e45e6259ac520-neeva_2_0.txt,Doing so will push back against voter suppression and tear down barriers to participation because the best way to protect the right to vote is to underscore that it is also a civic duty.,complete_support,False,voting - vote - age - jury - felony - trial - convictions - voter - turnout - mandatory,StanfordCitation,0.71,0.5633333333333334,0.49,0.49,[0.9758864641189575],[0.9758864641189575]

PATA cables are flat with **40-pin connectors** on either side. One end of the cable plugs into a port on the motherboard, usually labeled IDE.","One end of the cable plugs into a port on the motherboard, usually labeled IDE.","PATA, short for Parallel ATA, is an IDE standard for connecting storage devices like hard drives and optical drives to the motherboard .
PATA generally refers to the types of cables and connections that follow this standard.
It's important to note that the term Parallel ATA used to simply be called ATA . ATA was retroactively renamed to Parallel ATA when the newer Serial ATA (SATA) standard came into being.
Even though PATA and SATA are both IDE standards, PATA (formally ATA) cables and connectors are often referred to simply as IDE cables and connectors. It's not a correct usage but it's very popular nonetheless.
PATA cables are flat with 40-pin connectors (in a 20x2 matrix) on either side.
One end of the cable plugs into a port on the motherboard, usually labeled IDE , and the other into the back of a storage device like a hard drive.
Some cables have an additional PATA connector midway through the cable for connecting yet another device, like a PATA hard drive or an optical disk drive.
PATA cables come in 40-wire or 80-wire designs. Newer PATA storage devices require the use of the more capable 80-wire cable to meet certain speed requirements. Both types have 40-pins and look nearly identical, so telling them apart can be difficult. Although usually, the connectors on an 80-wire cable will be black, gray, and blue while 40-wire cable connectors will only be black.
ATA-4 drives, or UDMA-33 drives, can transfer data at a maximum rate of 33 MB/s. ATA-6 devices support up to 100 MB/s speeds and might be called PATA/100 drives.
The maximum allowable length of a PATA cable is 18 inches (457 mm).
Molex is the power connector for PATA hard drives. This connection is what extends out from the power supply for the PATA device to draw power.
You might need to use an older PATA device in a newer system that only has SATA cabling. Or, you might need to do the opposite and use a newer SATA device on an older computer that just supports PATA. Maybe you want to connect a PATA hard drive to a computer to run virus scans or back up files.
You need an adapter for those conversions:
- Use a SATA to Molex power connector adapter to use an older PATA device with a power supply that uses 15-pin cable connections . StarTech's SATA to Molex LP4 Power Cable Adapter would work well for this.
- Use a Molex to SATA adapter to hook up a SATA device with an older power supply that just supports PATA devices with 4-pin power connections . You can use something like this Molex to SATA Female Adapter Cable to make a Molex connector work with a SATA device.
- Use an IDE to USB adapter to connect a PATA hard drive to a computer through USB . One example is the C2G IDE or Serial ATA Drive Adapter Cable .
Since PATA is an older technology, it only makes sense that most of the discussion about PATA and SATA will favor the newer SATA cabling and devices.
PATA cables are big compared to SATA cables. This makes it harder to tie up and manage the cabling when it's laying over other devices in the way. On a similar note, the large cable makes it harder for the computer components to cool down since airflow has to make its way around the bigger cable, something that isn't as much of a problem with slimmer SATA cables.
PATA cables are also more expensive than SATA cables because it costs more to manufacture one. This is true even though SATA cables are newer.
Another benefit of SATA over PATA is that SATA devices support hot-swapping, which means you don't have to shut down the device before you unplug it. If you need to remove a PATA drive, it's necessary to actually shut off the entire computer first.
One advantage that PATA cables have over SATA cables is that they can have two devices attached to the cable at one time. One is referred to as device 0 (primary) and the other device 1 (secondary). SATA hard drives just have two connection points—one for the device and the other for the motherboard.
One common misconception about using two devices on one cable is that they will both perform only as fast as the slowest device. However, modern ATA adapters support what's called independent device timing , which lets both devices transfer data at their best speed (of course, only up to the speed supported by the cable).
PATA devices are supported by really old operating systems like Windows 98 and 95, while SATA devices are not. Also, some SATA devices require a certain device driver in order to fully function.
eSATA devices are external SATA devices that can connect to the back of the computer with ease using a SATA cable. PATA cables, however, are only allowed to be 18 inches long, which makes it extremely difficult if not impossible to use a PATA device anywhere but inside the computer case .
It's for this reason that external PATA devices use a different technology like USB to bridge the distance.

Bresch said the company's profit on its $609 EipPen two-packs is about $50 per pen. She also indicated Mylan ( MYL ) has no plan to lower its price for EpiPens.
Her defense of Mylan's pricing unleashed a barrage of comments from lawmakers, including one who said, ""We don't believe you.""
Members of the House Oversight Committee spent hours telling Bresch that the cost of an EpiPen two-pack -- about $500 more today then when Mylan bought rights to sell the device in 2007 -- was ""sickening.""
Also damning, they said, were the hundreds of millions of dollars pocketed by Mylan's top five executives in recent years.
""Yet another drug company, Mylan, has jacked up the price of a lifesaving product for no discernible reason,"" Elijah Cummings, a Democrat from Maryland, told Bresch as the hearing opened.
He said it was happening so the company could get ""filthy rich at the expense of our constituents.""
Bresch said the company has tried to make amends by offering $300 savings cards for patients who have to pay full price, and said Mylan ""listened and focused on this issue and came up with a sustainable solution.""
But when asked if Mylan would cut the cost of its best-selling product, Bresch indicated it wouldn't. She instead suggested a planned generic version the company will market at $300.
Jason Chaffetz, a Republican from Utah, suggested a generic version would actually make more for Mylan because the company plans to sell it directly to customers.
""This is why we don't believe you,"" Chaffetz said.
Committee members turned to the FDA for information about any alternatives to the EpiPen, which has a near-monopoly in its market.
But Douglas Throckmorton, the FDA's deputy director for regulatory programs, wouldn't comment about pending applications the department is reviewing.
That left many lawmakers visibly frustrated.
""It's too hard to get new products approved in this country,"" said Representative Mick Mulvaney, a Republican from South Carolina.
Bresch was also widely criticized by the committee for her own compensation. Public filings show she's doubled her income from $9 million when she took over as CEO in 2012 to $18 million last year.
But she insisted that Mylan's gains haven't been outrageous, and told the committee her payout was ""in the middle"" of what her industry peers make.
A review of Mylan profits by David Maris, a pharmaceutical analyst at Wells Fargo, shows that the unit that markets EpiPen increased its operating profit margin from 8.8% in 2008 to 60.3% in 2016.
The EpiPen's price was hiked 16 times during that time.
The treatment is also at the center of several antitrust investigations related to Mylan's school distribution program.

This article is about the genre of fiction and associated subculture. For other uses, see Steampunk (disambiguation) .
Steampunk is a subgenre of science fiction that incorporates retrofuturistic technology and aesthetics inspired by 19th-century industrial steam-powered machinery. [1] [2] [3] Steampunk works are often set in an alternative history of the Victorian era or the American ""Wild West"" , where steam power remains in mainstream use, or in a fantasy world that similarly employs steam power.
Steampunk most recognizably features anachronistic technologies or retrofuturistic inventions as people in the 19th century might have envisioned them — distinguishing it from Neo-Victorianism [4] — and is likewise rooted in the era's perspective on fashion, culture, architectural style, and art. [5] Such technologies may include fictional machines like those found in the works of H. G. Wells and Jules Verne . [6] Other examples of steampunk contain alternative-history-style presentations of such technology as steam cannons , lighter-than-air airships , analog computers , or such digital mechanical computers as Charles Babbage 's Analytical Engine . [7] [8]
Steampunk may also incorporate additional elements from the genres of fantasy , horror , historical fiction , alternate history, or other branches of speculative fiction , making it often a hybrid genre . [9] As a form of speculative fiction, it explores alternative futures or pasts but can also address real-world social issues. [10] The first known appearance of the term steampunk was in 1987, though it now retroactively refers to many works of fiction created as far back as the 1950s or earlier [11] A popular subgenre is Japanese steampunk, consisting of steampunk-themed manga and anime , [12] with steampunk elements having appeared in mainstream manga since the 1940s. [13]
Steampunk also refers to any of the artistic styles, clothing fashions, or subcultures that have developed from the aesthetics of steampunk fiction, Victorian-era fiction, art nouveau design, and films from the mid-20th century. [14] Various modern utilitarian objects have been modded by individual artisans into a pseudo-Victorian mechanical ""steampunk"" style, and a number of visual and musical artists have been described as steampunk. [15]
Steampunk is influenced by and often adopts the style of the 19th-century scientific romances of Jules Verne , H. G. Wells , Mary Shelley , and Edward S. Ellis 's The Steam Man of the Prairies . [16] Several more modern works of art and fiction significant to the development of the genre were produced before the genre had a name. Titus Alone (1959), by Mervyn Peake , is widely regarded by scholars as the first novel in the genre proper, [17] [18] [19] while others point to Michael Moorcock 's 1971 novel The Warlord of the Air , [20] [21] [22] which was heavily influenced by Peake's work. The film Brazil (1985) was an early cinematic influence, although it can also be considered a precursor to the steampunk offshoot dieselpunk . [23] The Adventures of Luther Arkwright was an early (1970s) comic version of the Moorcock -style mover between timestreams . [24] [25]
In fine art, Remedios Varo 's paintings combine elements of Victorian dress, fantasy, and technofantasy imagery. [26] [ page needed ] In television , one of the earliest manifestations of the steampunk ethos in the mainstream media was the CBS television series The Wild Wild West (1965–69), which inspired the later film .

Although many works now considered seminal to the genre were published in the 1960s and 1970s, the term steampunk originated largely in the 1980s [27] as a tongue-in-cheek variant of cyberpunk . It was coined by science fiction author K. W. Jeter , [28] who was trying to find a general term for works by Tim Powers ( The Anubis Gates , 1983), James Blaylock ( Homunculus , 1986), and himself ( Morlock Night , 1979, and Infernal Devices , 1987) — all of which took place in a 19th-century (usually Victorian) setting and imitated conventions of such actual Victorian speculative fiction as H. G. Wells ' The Time Machine . In a letter to science fiction magazine Locus , [27] printed in the April 1987 issue, Jeter wrote:
Dear Locus,
Enclosed is a copy of my 1979 novel Morlock Night ; I'd appreciate your being so good as to route it to Faren Miller, as it's a prime piece of evidence in the great debate as to who in ""the Powers/Blaylock/Jeter fantasy triumvirate"" was writing in the ""gonzo-historical manner"" first. Though of course, I did find her review in the March Locus to be quite flattering.
Personally, I think Victorian fantasies are going to be the next big thing, as long as we can come up with a fitting collective term for Powers, Blaylock and myself. Something based on the appropriate technology of the era; like ""steam-punks,"" perhaps....
While Jeter's Morlock Night and Infernal Devices , Powers' The Anubis Gates , and Blaylock's Lord Kelvin's Machine were the first novels to which Jeter's neologism would be applied, the three authors gave the term little thought at the time. [7] : 48 They were far from the first modern science fiction writers to speculate on the development of steam-based technology or alternative histories. Keith Laumer 's Worlds of the Imperium (1962) and Ronald W. Clark 's Queen Victoria's Bomb (1967) apply modern speculation to past-age technology and society. [31] [ page needed ] Michael Moorcock 's Warlord of the Air (1971) [22] is another early example. Harry Harrison 's novel A Transatlantic Tunnel, Hurrah! (1973) portrays Britain in an alternative 1973, full of atomic locomotives, coal-powered flying boats, ornate submarines, and Victorian dialogue. The Adventures of Luther Arkwright (mid-1970s) was one of the first steampunk comics. [ citation needed ] In February 1980, Richard A. Lupoff and Steve Stiles published the first ""chapter"" of their 10-part comic strip The Adventures of Professor Thintwhistle and His Incredible Aether Flyer . [32] In 2004, one anonymous author described steampunk as ""Colonizing the Past so we can dream the future."" [33]
The first use of the word ""steampunk"" in a title was in Paul Di Filippo 's 1995 Steampunk Trilogy , [22] consisting of three short novels: ""Victoria"", ""Hottentots"", and ""Walt and Emily"", which, respectively, imagine the replacement of Queen Victoria by a human/newt clone, an invasion of Massachusetts by Lovecraftian monsters, and a love affair between Walt Whitman and Emily Dickinson .

Japanese steampunk consists of steampunk manga comics and anime productions from Japan. [12] Steampunk elements have consistently appeared in mainstream manga since the 1940s, dating back to Osamu Tezuka 's epic science-fiction trilogy consisting of Lost World (1948), Metropolis (1949) and Nextworld (1951). The steampunk elements found in manga eventually made their way into mainstream anime productions starting in the 1970s, including television shows such as Leiji Matsumoto 's Space Battleship Yamato (1974) and the 1979 anime adaptation of Riyoko Ikeda 's manga Rose of Versailles (1972). Influenced by 19th-century European authors such as Jules Verne, steampunk anime and manga arose from a Japanese fascination with an imaginary fantastical version of old Industrial Europe, linked to a phenomenon called akogare no Pari (""the Paris of our dreams""), comparable to the West 's fascination with an ""exotic"" East . [13]
The most influential steampunk animator was Hayao Miyazaki , who was creating steampunk anime since the 1970s, starting with the television show Future Boy Conan (1978). [13] His manga Nausicaä of the Valley of the Wind (1982) and its 1984 anime film adaptation also contained steampunk elements. Miyazaki's most influential steampunk production was the Studio Ghibli anime film Laputa: Castle in the Sky (1986), which became a major milestone in the genre and has been described by The Steampunk Bible as ""one of the first modern steampunk classics."" [34] Archetypal steampunk elements in Laputa include airships , air pirates , steam-powered robots , and a view of steam power as a limitless but potentially dangerous source of power. [13]
The success of Laputa inspired Hideaki Anno and Studio Gainax to create their first hit production, Nadia: The Secret of Blue Water (1990), a steampunk anime show which loosely adapts elements from Verne's Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea , with Captain Nemo making an appearance. [13] Based on a concept by Miyazaki, Nadia was influential on later steampunk anime such as Katsuhiro Otomo 's anime film Steamboy (2004). [35] Disney 's animated steampunk film Atlantis: The Lost Empire (2001) [16] was influenced by anime, particularly Miyazaki's works and possibly Nadia . [36] [37] Other popular Japanese steampunk works include Miyazaki's Studio Ghibli anime films Porco Rosso (1992) [12] and Howl's Moving Castle (2004), [13] Sega 's video game and anime franchise Sakura Wars (1996) which is set in a steampunk version of Meiji / Taishō era Japan, [13] and Square Enix 's manga and anime franchise Fullmetal Alchemist (2001). [12]
Steampunk used to be confused with retrofuturism . [38] Indeed, both sensibilities recall ""the older but still modern eras in which technological change seemed to anticipate a better world, one remembered as relatively innocent of industrial decline."" For some scholars, retrofuturism is considered a strand of steampunk, one that looks at alternatives to historical imagination and usually created with the same kinds of social protagonists and written for the same type of audiences. [39]
One of steampunk's most significant contributions is the way in which it mixes digital media with traditional handmade art forms. As scholars Rachel Bowser and Brian Croxall put it, ""the tinkering and tinker-able technologies within steampunk invite us to roll up our sleeves and get to work re-shaping our contemporary world."" [40] In this respect, steampunk bears more in common with DIY craft and making. [41]

Many of the visualisations of steampunk have their origins with, among others, Walt Disney 's film 20,000 Leagues Under the Sea (1954), [42] including the design of the story's submarine the Nautilus , its interiors, and the crew's underwater gear; and George Pal 's film The Time Machine (1960), especially the design of the time machine itself. This theme is also carried over to Six Flags Magic Mountain and Disney parks, in the themed area the ""Screampunk District"" at Six Flags Magic Mountain and in the designs of The Mysterious Island section of Tokyo DisneySea theme park and Disneyland Paris ' Discoveryland area. [ citation needed ]
Aspects of steampunk design emphasise a balance between form and function. [43] In this it is like the Arts and Crafts Movement . But John Ruskin , William Morris , and the other reformers in the late nineteenth century rejected machines and industrial production. In contrast, steampunk enthusiasts present a ""non- luddite critique of technology"". [44]
Various modern utilitarian objects have been modified by enthusiasts into a pseudo-Victorian mechanical ""steampunk"" style. [25] [45] Examples include computer keyboards and electric guitars . [46] The goal of such redesigns is to employ appropriate materials (such as polished brass, iron, wood, and leather) with design elements and craftsmanship consistent with the Victorian era, [22] [47] rejecting the aesthetic of industrial design . [43]
In 1994, the Paris Metro station at Arts et Métiers was redesigned by Belgian artist Francois Schuiten in steampunk style, to honor the works of Jules Verne. The station is reminiscent of a submarine, sheathed in brass with giant cogs in the ceiling and portholes that look out onto fanciful scenes. [48] [49]
The artist group Kinetic Steam Works [50] brought a working steam engine to the Burning Man festival in 2006 and 2007. [51] The group's founding member, Sean Orlando, created a Steampunk Tree House (in association with a group of people who would later form the Five Ton Crane Arts Group [52] ) that has been displayed at a number of festivals. [53] [54] The Steampunk Tree House is now permanently installed at the Dogfish Head Brewery in Milton, Delaware . [55]
The Neverwas Haul is a three-story, self-propelled mobile art vehicle built to resemble a Victorian house on wheels. Designed by Shannon O’Hare, it was built by volunteers in 2006 and presented at the Burning Man festival from 2006 through 2015. [56] When fully built, the Haul propelled itself at a top speed of 5 miles per hour and required a crew of ten people to operate safely. Currently, the Neverwas Haul makes her home at Obtainium Works, an ""art car factory"" in Vallejo, CA owned by O’Hare and home to several other self-styled ""contraptionists"". [57]
In May–June 2008, multimedia artist and sculptor Paul St George exhibited outdoor interactive video installations linking London and Brooklyn , New York, in a Victorian era-styled telectroscope . [58] [59] Utilizing this device, New York promoter Evelyn Kriete organised a transatlantic wave between steampunk enthusiasts from both cities, [60] prior to White Mischief's Around the World in 80 Days steampunk-themed event. [61]
In 2009, for Questacon , artist Tim Wetherell created a large wall piece that represented the concept of the clockwork universe. This steel artwork contains moving gears, a working clock, and a movie of the moon's terminator in action. The 3D moon movie was created by Antony Williams. [62]
Steampunk became a common descriptor for homemade objects sold on the craft network Etsy between 2009 and 2011, [63] though many of the objects and fashions bear little resemblance to earlier established descriptions of steampunk. Thus the craft network may not strike observers as ""sufficiently steampunk"" to warrant its use of the term. Comedian April Winchell , author of the book Regretsy: Where DIY meets WTF , cataloged some of the most egregious and humorous examples on her website ""Regretsy"". [64] The blog was popular among steampunks and even inspired a music video that went viral in the community and was acclaimed by steampunk ""notables"". [65]
From October 2009 through February 2010, the Museum of the History of Science, Oxford , hosted the first major exhibition of steampunk art objects, curated and developed by New York artist and designer Art Donovan, [66] who also exhibited his own ""electro-futuristic"" lighting sculptures, and presented by Dr. Jim Bennett, museum director. [67] From redesigned practical items to fantastical contraptions, this exhibition showcased the work of eighteen steampunk artists from around the globe. The exhibit proved to be the most successful and highly attended in the museum's history and attracted more than eighty thousand visitors. The event was detailed in the official artist's journal The Art of Steampunk , by curator Donovan. [68]
In November 2010, The Libratory Steampunk Art Gallery was opened by Damien McNamara in Oamaru, New Zealand . Created from papier-mâché to resemble a large cave and filled with industrial equipment from yesteryear, rayguns , and general steampunk quirks, its purpose is to provide a place for steampunkers in the region to display artwork for sale all year long. A year later, a more permanent gallery, Steampunk HQ , was opened in the former Meeks Grain Elevator Building across the road from The Woolstore, and has since become a notable tourist attraction for Oamaru. [69]
In 2012, the Mobilis in Mobili: An Exhibition of Steampunk Art and Appliance made its debut. Originally located at New York City's Wooster Street Social Club (itself the subject of the television series NY Ink ), the exhibit featured working steampunk tattoo systems designed by Bruce Rosenbaum, of ModVic and owner of the Steampunk House, [70] Joey ""Dr. Grymm"" Marsocci, [46] and Christopher Conte. [71] with different approaches. [42] ""[B]icycles, cell phones, guitars, timepieces and entertainment systems"" [71] rounded out the display. [46] The opening night exhibition featured a live performance by steampunk band Frenchy and the Punk . [72]
The stills at The Oxford Artisan Distillery are nicknamed "" Nautilus "" and "" Nemo "", named after the submarine and its captain in the Jules Verne 1870 science fiction novel Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Seas . They were built in copper by South Devon Railway Engineering using a steampunk style. [73]

Steampunk fashion has no set guidelines but tends to synthesize modern styles with influences from the Victorian era. Such influences may include bustles , corsets , gowns, and petticoats ; suits with waistcoats , coats, top hats [74] and bowler hats (themselves originating in 1850 England), tailcoats and spats ; or military-inspired garments. Steampunk-influenced outfits are usually accented with several technological and ""period"" accessories: timepieces, parasols , flying/driving goggles, [75] and ray guns. Modern accessories like cell phones or music players can be found in steampunk outfits, after being modified to give them the appearance of Victorian-era objects. Post-apocalyptic elements, such as gas masks, ragged clothing, and tribal motifs, can also be included. Aspects of steampunk fashion have been anticipated by mainstream high fashion, the Lolita and aristocrat styles, neo-Victorianism, and the Romantic Goth subculture . [24] [76] [77]
In 2005, Kate Lambert , known as ""Kato"", founded the first steampunk clothing company, ""Steampunk Couture"", [78] mixing Victorian and post-apocalyptic influences. In 2013, IBM predicted, based on an analysis of more than a half million public posts on message boards, blogs, social media sites, and news sources, ""that 'steampunk,' a subgenre inspired by the clothing, technology and social mores of Victorian society, will be a major trend to bubble up and take hold of the retail industry"". [79] [80] Indeed, high fashion lines such as Prada , [81] Dolce & Gabbana , Versace , Chanel , [82] and Christian Dior [80] had already been introducing steampunk styles on the fashion runways.
In episode 7 of Lifetime 's Under the Gunn reality series , contestants were challenged to create avant-garde ""steampunk chic"" looks. [83] America's Next Top Model tackled steampunk fashion in a 2012 episode where models competed in a steampunk-themed photo shoot, posing in front of a steam train while holding a live owl. [84] [ unreliable source ]
The educational book Elementary BASIC – Learning to Program Your Computer in BASIC with Sherlock Holmes (1981), by Henry Singer and Andrew Ledgar , may have been the first fictional work to depict the use of Charles Babbage 's Analytical Engine in an adventure story. The instructional book, aimed at young programming students, depicts Holmes using the engine as an aid in his investigations, and lists programs that perform simple data processing tasks required to solve the fictional cases. The book even describes a device that allows the engine to be used remotely, over telegraph lines, as a possible enhancement to Babbage's machine. Companion volumes— Elementary Pascal – Learning to Program Your Computer in Pascal with Sherlock Holmes and From Baker Street to Binary – An Introduction to Computers and Computer Programming with Sherlock Holmes —were also written.
In 1988, the first version of the science fiction tabletop role-playing game Space: 1889 was published. The game is set in an alternative history in which certain now discredited Victorian scientific theories were probable and led to new technologies. Contributing authors included Frank Chadwick , Loren Wiseman , and Marcus Rowland . [85]
William Gibson and Bruce Sterling 's novel The Difference Engine (1990) is often credited with bringing about widespread awareness of steampunk. [8] [86] This novel applies the principles of Gibson and Sterling's cyberpunk writings to an alternative Victorian era where Ada Lovelace and Charles Babbage 's proposed steam-powered mechanical computer, which Babbage called a difference engine (a later, more general-purpose version was known as an Analytical Engine ), was actually built, and led to the dawn of the information age more than a century ""ahead of schedule"". This setting was different from most steampunk settings in that it takes a dim and dark view of this future, rather than the more prevalent utopian versions.
Nick Gevers 's original anthology Extraordinary Engines (2008) features newer steampunk stories by some of the genre's writers, as well as other science fiction and fantasy writers experimenting with neo-Victorian conventions. A retrospective reprint anthology of steampunk fiction was released, also in 2008, by Tachyon Publications . Edited by Ann and Jeff VanderMeer and appropriately entitled Steampunk , it is a collection of stories by James Blaylock , whose ""Narbondo"" trilogy is typically considered steampunk; Jay Lake , author of the novel Mainspring , sometimes labeled "" clockpunk ""; [87] the aforementioned Michael Moorcock; as well as Jess Nevins , known for his annotations to The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen (first published in 1999).
Younger readers have also been targeted by steampunk themes, by authors such as Philip Reeve and Scott Westerfeld . [88] Reeve's quartet Mortal Engines is set far in Earth's future where giant moving cities consume each other in a battle for resources, a concept Reeve coined as Municipal Darwinism . Westerfeld's Leviathan trilogy is set during an alternate First World War fought between the ""clankers"" ( Central Powers ), who use steam technology, and ""darwinists"" ( Allied Powers ), who use genetically engineered creatures instead of machines. [89]
""Mash-ups"" are also becoming increasingly popular in books aimed at younger readers, mixing steampunk with other genres. Stefan Bachmann 's The Peculiar duology was labeled a ""steampunk fairytale,"" and imagines steampunk technology as a means to stave off an incursion of faeries in Victorian England. [90] Suzanne Lazear's Aether Chronicles series also mixes steampunk with faeries, and The Unnaturalists , by Tiffany Trent, combines steampunk with mythological creatures and alternate history. [91]
While most of the original steampunk works had a historical setting, [ citation needed ] later works often place steampunk elements in a fantasy world with little relation to any specific historic era. Historical steampunk tends to be science fiction that presents an alternate history; it also contains real locales and persons from history with alternative fantasy technology. ""Fantasy-world steampunk"", such as China Miéville 's Perdido Street Station , Alan Campbell's Scar Night , and Stephen Hunt's Jackelian novels, on the other hand, presents steampunk in a completely imaginary fantasy realm , often populated by legendary creatures coexisting with steam-era and other anachronistic technologies. However, the works of China Miéville and similar authors are sometimes referred to as belonging to the "" New Weird "" rather than steampunk. [ citation needed ]
Self-described author of ""far-fetched fiction"" Robert Rankin has incorporated elements of steampunk into narrative worlds that are both Victorian and re-imagined contemporary. In 2009, he was made a Fellow of the Victorian Steampunk Society. [92]
The comic book series Hellboy , created by Mike Mignola , and the two Hellboy films featuring Ron Perlman and directed by Guillermo del Toro , all have steampunk elements. [93] In the comic book and the first (2004) film , Karl Ruprecht Kroenen is a Nazi SS scientist who has an addiction to having himself surgically altered, and who has many mechanical prostheses, including a clockwork heart. The character Johann Krauss is featured in the comic and in the second film, Hellboy II: The Golden Army (2008), as an ectoplasmic medium (a gaseous form in a partly mechanical suit). This second film also features the Golden Army itself, which is a collection of 4,900 mechanical steampunk warriors.
Since the 1990s, the application of the steampunk label has expanded beyond works set in recognisable historical periods, to works set in fantasy worlds that rely heavily on steam- or spring-powered technology. [8] One of the earliest short stories relying on steam-powered flying machines is ""The Aerial Burglar"" of 1844. [94] An example from juvenile fiction is The Edge Chronicles by Paul Stewart and Chris Riddell .
One of the first steampunk novels set in a Middle-earth -like world was the Forest of Boland Light Railway by BB , about gnomes who build a steam locomotive . Fifty years later, Terry Pratchett wrote the Discworld novel Raising Steam , about the ongoing industrial revolution and railway mania in Ankh-Morpork .
The gnomes and goblins in World of Warcraft also have technological societies that could be described as steampunk, [97] as they are vastly ahead of the technologies of men , but still run on steam and mechanical power.
The Dwarves of the Elder Scrolls series , described therein as a race of Elves called the Dwemer , also use steam-powered machinery, with gigantic brass-like gears, throughout their underground cities. However, magical means are used to keep ancient devices in motion despite the Dwemer's ancient disappearance. [98]
The 1998 game Thief: The Dark Project , as well as the other sequels including its 2014 reboot , feature heavy steampunk-inspired architecture, setting, and technology.
Amidst the historical and fantasy subgenres of steampunk is a type that takes place in a hypothetical future or a fantasy equivalent of our future involving the domination of steampunk-style technology and aesthetics . Examples include Jean-Pierre Jeunet and Marc Caro 's The City of Lost Children (1995), Turn A Gundam (1999–2000), Trigun , [99] and Disney's film Treasure Planet (2002). In 2011, musician Thomas Dolby heralded his return to music after a 20-year hiatus with an online steampunk alternate fantasy world called the Floating City, to promote his album A Map of the Floating City . [16]
Another setting is ""Western"" steampunk, which overlaps with both the Weird West and Science fiction Western subgenres. One of the earliest steampunk books set in America was The Steam Man of the Prairies by Edward S. Ellis . Recent examples include the TV show and the movie adaption Wild Wild West , the Italian comics about Magico Vento , [100] Devon Monk 's Dead Iron , [101] and the Big Thunder Mountain Railroad in Disneyland -style Disney Parks around the world.

Kaja Foglio introduced the term ""Gaslight Romance"", [7] : 78 gaslamp fantasy , which John Clute and John Grant define as ""steampunk stories ... most commonly set in a romanticised, smoky, 19th-century London, as are Gaslight Romances. But the latter category focuses nostalgically on icons from the late years of that century and the early years of the 20th century—on Dracula , Jekyll and Hyde , Jack the Ripper , Sherlock Holmes and even Tarzan —and can normally be understood as combining supernatural fiction and recursive fantasy , though some gaslight romances can be read as fantasies of history."" [9] Author/artist James Richardson-Brown [102] coined the term steamgoth to refer to steampunk expressions of fantasy and horror with a ""darker"" bent.
Mary Shelley 's The Last Man , set near the end of the 21st century after a plague had brought down civilization, was probably the ancestor of post-apocalyptic steampunk literature. Post-apocalyptic steampunk is set in a world where some cataclysm has precipitated the fall of civilization and steam power is once again ascendant, such as in Hayao Miyazaki 's post-apocalyptic anime Future Boy Conan (1978, loosely based on Alexander Key 's The Incredible Tide (1970)), [99] where a war fought with superweapons has devastated the planet. Robert Brown 's novel, The Wrath of Fate (as well as much of Abney Park 's music) is set in a Victorianesque world where an apocalypse was set into motion by a time-traveling mishap. Cherie Priest 's Boneshaker series is set in a world where a zombie apocalypse happened during the Civil War era. The Peshawar Lancers by S.M. Stirling is set in a post-apocalyptic future in which a meteor shower in 1878 caused the collapse of industrialized civilization. The movie 9 (which might be better classified as ""stitchpunk"" but was largely influenced by steampunk) [103] is also set in a post-apocalyptic world after a self-aware war machine ran amok. Steampunk Magazine even published a book called A Steampunk's Guide to the Apocalypse , about how steampunks could survive should such a thing actually happen.
In general, this category includes any recent science fiction that takes place in a recognizable historical period (sometimes an alternate history version of an actual historical period) in which the Industrial Revolution has already begun, but electricity is not yet widespread, ""usually Britain of the early to mid-nineteenth century or the fantasized Wild West -era United States"", [104] with an emphasis on steam- or spring-propelled gadgets. The most common historical steampunk settings are the Victorian and Edwardian eras , though some in this ""Victorian steampunk"" category are set as early as the beginning of the Industrial Revolution and as late as the end of World War I .
Some examples of this type include the novel The Difference Engine , [105] the comic book series League of Extraordinary Gentlemen , the Disney animated film Atlantis: The Lost Empire , [16] Scott Westerfeld 's Leviathan trilogy , [106] and the roleplaying game Space: 1889 . [16] The anime film Steamboy (2004) is another example of Victorian steampunk, taking place in an alternate 1866 where steam technology is far more advanced than reality. [107] Some, such as the comic series Girl Genius , [16] have their own unique times and places despite partaking heavily of the flavor of historic settings. Other comic series are set in a more familiar London, as in the Victorian Undead , which has Sherlock Holmes , Doctor Watson , and others taking on zombies, Doctor Jekyll and Mister Hyde , and Count Dracula , with advanced weapons and devices. Another example of this genre is the Tunnels novels by Roderick Gordon and Brian Williams. These are set in the modern day, but with an underground Victorian world that is working to overthrow the world above. Detective graphic novel series Lady Mechanika is set in an alternative Victorian-like world.
Karel Zeman 's film The Fabulous World of Jules Verne (1958) is a very early example of cinematic steampunk. Based on Jules Verne novels, Zeman's film imagines a past that never was, based on those novels. [108] Other early examples of historical steampunk in cinema include Hayao Miyazaki 's anime films such as Laputa: Castle in the Sky (1986) and Howl's Moving Castle (2004), which contain many archetypal anachronisms characteristic of the steampunk genre. [109] [110]
""Historical"" steampunk usually leans more towards science fiction than fantasy, but a number of historical steampunk stories have incorporated magical elements as well. For example, Morlock Night , written by K. W. Jeter , revolves around an attempt by the wizard Merlin to raise King Arthur to save the Britain of 1892 from an invasion of Morlocks from the future. [8]
Paul Guinan 's Boilerplate , a ""biography"" of a robot in the late 19th century, began as a website that garnered international press coverage when people began believing that Photoshop images of the robot with historic personages were real. [111] The site was adapted into the illustrated hardbound book Boilerplate: History's Mechanical Marvel , which was published by Abrams in October 2009. [112] Because the story was not set in an alternative history, and in fact contained accurate information about the Victorian era, [113] some [ specify ] booksellers referred to the tome as ""historical steampunk"".
Fictional settings inspired by East Asian rather than Western history, especially those inspired by Chinese history , have been called ""silkpunk"". The term originated with the author Ken Liu , [114] who defined it as ""a blend of science fiction and fantasy [that] draws inspiration from classical East Asian antiquity"", with a ""technology vocabulary (...) based on organic materials historically important to East Asia (bamboo, paper, silk) and seafaring cultures of the Pacific (coconut, feathers, coral)"", rather than the brass and leather associated with steampunk. Liu used the term to describe his Dandelion Dynasty series, which began in 2015. [115] Other works described as silkpunk include Neon Yang 's Tensorate series of novellas, which began in 2017. [116] Lyndsie Manusos of Book Riot has argued that the genre does ""not fit in a direct analogy with steampunk. Silkpunk is technology and poetics. It is engineering and language."" [117]
Steampunk music is very broadly defined. Abney Park 's lead singer Robert Brown defined it as ""mixing Victorian elements and modern elements"". There is a broad range of musical influences that make up the steampunk sound, from industrial dance and world music [77] to folk rock , dark cabaret to straightforward punk , [118] Carnatic [119] to industrial , hip-hop to opera (and even industrial hip-hop opera ), [120] [121] darkwave to progressive rock , barbershop to big band .
Joshua Pfeiffer (of Vernian Process ) is quoted as saying, ""As for Paul Roland , if anyone deserves credit for spearheading Steampunk music, it is him. He was one of the inspirations I had in starting my project. He was writing songs about the first attempt at manned flight, and an Edwardian airship raid in the mid-80s long before almost anyone else ..."" [122] Thomas Dolby is also considered one of the early pioneers of retro-futurist (i.e., Steampunk and Dieselpunk) music. [123] [124] Amanda Palmer was once quoted as saying, ""Thomas Dolby is to Steampunk what Iggy Pop was to Punk !"" [125]
Steampunk has also appeared in the work of musicians who do not specifically identify as steampunk. For example, the music video of ""Turn Me On"" , by David Guetta and featuring Nicki Minaj , takes place in a steampunk universe where Guetta creates human androids. Another music video is "" The Ballad of Mona Lisa "", by Panic! at the Disco , which has a distinct Victorian steampunk theme. A continuation of this theme has been used throughout the 2011 album Vices & Virtues , in the music videos, album art, and tour set and costumes. In addition, the album Clockwork Angels (2012) and its supporting tour by progressive rock band Rush contain lyrics, themes, and imagery based around steampunk. Similarly, Abney Park headlined the first ""Steamstock"" outdoor steampunk music festival in Richmond, California , which also featured Thomas Dolby , Frenchy and the Punk , Lee Presson and the Nails , Vernian Process , and others. [124]
The music video for the Lindsey Stirling song ""Roundtable Rival"", has a Western steampunk setting.
The Fabulous World of Jules Verne (1958) and The Fabulous Baron Munchausen (1962), both directed by Karel Zeman , have steampunk elements. The 1965 television series The Wild Wild West , as well as the 1999 film of the same name , features many elements of advanced steam-powered technology set in the Wild West time period of the United States. Two Years' Vacation (or The Stolen Airship ) (1967) directed by Karel Zeman contains steampunk elements.
The BBC series Doctor Who also incorporates steampunk elements. Several storylines can be classed as steampunk, most notably The Evil of the Daleks (1966), wherein Victorian scientists invent a time travel device using mirrors and static electricity. [126] During season 14 of the show (in 1976), the formerly futuristic looking interior set was replaced with a Victorian -styled wood-panel and brass affair. [127] In the 1996 American co-production, the TARDIS interior was re-designed to resemble an almost Victorian library with the central control console made up of an eclectic array of anachronistic objects. Modified and streamlined for the 2005 revival of the series, the TARDIS console continued to incorporate steampunk elements, including a Victorian typewriter and gramophone , for many years.
Dinner for Adele (1977) directed by Oldřich Lipský involves steampunk contraptions. The 1979 film Time After Time has Herbert George ""H.G."" Wells following a surgeon named John Leslie Stevenson into the future, as John is suspected of being Jack the Ripper . Both separately use Wells's time machine to travel.
The Mysterious Castle in the Carpathians , (1981) directed by Oldřich Lipský , contains steampunk elements. [128] The 1982 American TV series Q.E.D. is set in Edwardian England, stars Sam Waterston as Professor Quentin Everett Deverill (from whose initials, by which he is primarily known, the series title is derived, initials which also stand for the Latin phrase quod erat demonstrandum , which translates as ""which was to be demonstrated""). The Professor is an inventor and scientific detective, in the mold of Sherlock Holmes . The plot of the Soviet film Kin-dza-dza! (1986) centers on a desert planet , depleted of its resources, where an impoverished dog-eat-dog society uses steampunk machines, the movements and functions of which defy Earthly logic.
In making his 1986 Japanese film Castle in the Sky , Hayao Miyazaki was heavily influenced by steampunk culture, the film featuring various airships and steampowered contraptions as well as a mysterious island that floats through the sky, accomplished not through magic as in most stories, but instead by harnessing the physical properties of a rare crystal—analogous to the lodestone used in the Laputa of Swift's Gulliver's Travels —augmented by massive propellers, as befitting the Victorian motif. [129] The first ""Wallace & Gromit"" animation "" A Grand Day Out "" (1989) features a space rocket in the steampunk style. [ citation needed ]

Despite leaning more towards Gothic influences, the ""parallel reality"" of Meanwhile, City, within the 2009 film Franklyn contains many steampunk themes, such as costumery, architecture, minimal use of electricity (with a preference for gaslight), and absence of modern technology (such as there being no motorised vehicles or advanced weaponry, and the manual management of information without computers).
The 2009–2014 Syfy television series Warehouse 13 features many steampunk-inspired objects and artifacts, including computer designs created by steampunk artisan Richard Nagy, a.k.a. ""Datamancer"". [131] The 2010 episode of the TV series Castle entitled ""Punked"" (which first aired on October 11, 2010) prominently features the steampunk subculture and uses Los Angeles -area steampunks (such as the League of STEAM ) as extras.

Designed by Yoshinori Satake and inspired by Hayao Miyazaki 's anime film Laputa: Castle in the Sky (1986), Steel Empire is set in an alternate timeline dominated by steam-powered technology. The commercial success of Steel Empire , both in Japan and the West, helped propel steampunk into the video game market , and had a significant influence on later steampunk games. The most notable steampunk game it influenced is Final Fantasy VI (1994), a Japanese role-playing game developed by Squaresoft and designed by Hiroyuki Ito for the Super Nintendo Entertainment System . Final Fantasy VI was both critically and commercially successful, and had a considerable influence on later steampunk video games. [35]

Hornby 's world of Bassett-Lowke steampunk models
Because of the popularity of steampunk, there is a growing movement of adults that want to establish steampunk as a culture and lifestyle. [145] Some fans of the genre adopt a steampunk aesthetic through fashion, [146] home decor, music, and film. While Steampunk is considered the amalgamation of Victorian aesthetic principles with modern sensibilities and technologies, [24] it can be more broadly categorised as neo-Victorianism , described by scholar Marie-Luise Kohlke as ""the afterlife of the nineteenth century in the cultural imaginary"". [147] The subculture has its own magazine, blogs, and online shops. [148]
In September 2012, a panel, chaired by steampunk entertainer Veronique Chevalier and with panelists including magician Pop Hadyn and members of the steampunk performance group the League of STEAM , was held at Stan Lee 's Comikaze Expo . The panel suggested that because steampunk was inclusive of and incorporated ideas from various other subcultures such as goth, neo-Victorian, and cyberpunk, as well as a growing number of fandoms , it was fast becoming a super-culture rather than a mere subculture. [149] Other steampunk notables such as Professor Elemental have expressed similar views about steampunk's inclusive diversity. [150]
Some have proposed a steampunk philosophy that incorporates punk-inspired anti-establishment sentiments typically bolstered by optimism about human potential. [151] A 2004 Steampunk Manifesto , later republished in SteamPunk Magazine , lamented that most ""so-called"" steampunk was nothing more than dressed-up recreationary nostalgia and proposed that ""authentic"" steampunk would ""take the levers of technology from the [technocrats] and powerful."" [152] American activist and performer Miriam Rosenberg Rocek impersonated anarcha-feminist Emma Goldman to inspire discussions around gender, society and politics. [4] SteamPunk Magazine was edited and published by anarchists. Its founder, Margaret Killjoy , argued ""there have always been radical politics at the core of steampunk."" [153] Diana M. Pho, a science-fiction editor and author of the multicultural steampunk blog Beyond Victoriana , similarly argued steampunk's "" progressive roots"" can be traced to its literary inspirations, including Verne's Captain Nemo . [154] Steampunk authors Phenderson Djèlí Clark , [155] Jaymee Goh, [156] Dru Pagliassotti , [157] and Charlie Stross [158] consider their work political.
These views are not universally shared. [76] Killjoy lamented that even some diehard enthusiasts believe steampunk ""has nothing to offer but designer clothes."" [153] Pho argued many steampunk fans ""don't like to acknowledge that their attitudes could be considered ideological."" [154] The largest online steampunk community, Brass Goggles , which is dedicated to what it calls the ""lighter side"" of steampunk, banned discussion about politics. Cory Gross, who was one of the first to write about the history and theory of steampunk, argued that the ""sepia-toned yesteryear more appropriate for Disney and grandparents than a vibrant and viable philosophy or culture"" denounced in the Steampunk Manifesto [152] was in fact representative of the genre. [159] Author Catherynne M. Valente called the punk in steampunk ""nearly meaningless."" [160] Kate Franklin and James Schafer, who at the time managed one of the largest steampunk groups on Facebook , admitted in 2011 that steampunk hadn't created the ""revolutionary, or even a particularly progressive"" community they wanted. [161] Blogger and podcaster Eric Renderking Fisk announced in 2017 that steampunk was no longer punk, since it had ""lost the anti-authoritarian, anti-establishment aspects."" [162]
Others argued explicitly against turning steampunk into a political movement, [163] preferring to see steampunk as ""escapism"" [164] or a ""fandom"". [165] In 2018, Nick Ottens, editor of the online alternate-history magazine Never Was , declared that the ""lighter side"" of steampunk had won out. [166] To the extent that steampunk is politicized , it appears to be an American and British phenomenon. Continental Europeans [167] and Latin Americans [168] are more likely to consider steampunk a hobby than a cause.
June 19, 2005 marked the grand opening of the world's first steampunk club night, ""Malediction Society"", in Los Angeles . [169] [170] The event ran for nearly 12 years at The Monte Cristo nightclub, interrupted by a single year residency at Argyle Hollywood, until both the club night and The Monte Cristo closed in April 2017. [170] Though the steampunk aesthetic eventually gave way to a more generic goth and industrial aesthetic, Malediction Society celebrated its roots every year with ""The Steampunk Ball"". [171]
2006 saw the first ""SalonCon"", a neo-Victorian/steampunk convention. It ran for three consecutive years and featured artists, musicians ( Voltaire and Abney Park), authors ( Catherynne M. Valente , Ekaterina Sedia , and G. D. Falksen ), salons led by people prominent in their respective fields, workshops and panels on steampunk—as well as a seance, ballroom dance instruction, and the Chrononauts' Parade. The event was covered by MTV [172] and The New York Times . [24] Since then, a number of popular steampunk conventions have sprung up the world over, with names like Steamcon ( Seattle ), the Steampunk World's Fair ( Piscataway, New Jersey ), Up in the Aether: The Steampunk Convention ( Dearborn, Michigan ), [173] Steampunk NZ ( Oamaru, New Zealand ), Steampunk Unlimited ( Strasburg Railroad , Lancaster, PA ). [174] Each year, on Mother's Day weekend, the city of Waltham, MA , turns over its city center and surrounding areas to host the Watch City Steampunk Festival , a US outdoor steampunk festival. In Kennebunk, ME the Brick Store Museum hosts the Southern Maine Steampunk Fair annually. [175] [176] During the first weekend of May, the Australian town of Nimmitabel celebrates Steampunk @ Altitude with some 2,000 attendance. [177]
In recent years, steampunk has also become a regular feature at San Diego Comic-Con International , with the Saturday of the four-day event being generally known among steampunks as ""Steampunk Day"", and culminating with a photo-shoot for the local press. [178] [179] In 2010, this was recorded in the Guinness Book of World Records as the world's largest steampunk photo shoot. [180] In 2013, Comic-Con announced four official 2013 T-shirts, one of them featuring the official Rick Geary Comic-Con toucan mascot in steampunk attire. [181] The Saturday steampunk ""after-party"" has also become a major event on the steampunk social calendar: in 2010, the headliners included The Slow Poisoner, Unextraordinary Gentlemen, and Voltaire, with Veronique Chevalier as Mistress of Ceremonies and special appearance by the League of STEAM ; [182] [183] in 2011, UXG returned with Abney Park. [184]
Steampunk has also sprung up recently at Renaissance Festivals and Renaissance Faires , in the US. Some festivals have organised events or a ""Steampunk Day"", while others simply support an open environment for donning steampunk attire. The Bristol Renaissance Faire in Kenosha, Wisconsin , on the Wisconsin / Illinois border, featured a Steampunk costume contest during the 2012 season, the previous two seasons having seen increasing participation in the phenomenon. [185]
Steampunk also has a growing following in the UK and Europe. The largest European event is "" Weekend at the Asylum "", held at The Lawn, Lincoln , every September since 2009. Organised as a not-for-profit event by the Victorian Steampunk Society, the Asylum is a dedicated steampunk event which takes over much of the historical quarter of Lincoln, England , along with Lincoln Castle . In 2011, there were over 1000 steampunks in attendance. The event features the Empire Ball, Majors Review, Bazaar Eclectica, and the international Tea Duelling final. [186] [187] The Surrey Steampunk Convivial was originally held in New Malden , but since 2019 has been held in Stoneleigh in southwestern London, within walking distance of H. G. Wells 's home. [188] The Surrey Steampunk Convivial started as an annual event in 2012, and now takes place thrice a year, and has spanned three boroughs and five venues. [189] Attendees have been interviewed by BBC Radio 4 for Phill Jupitus [190] and filmed by the BBC World Service . [191] The West Yorkshire village of Haworth has held an annual Steampunk weekend since 2013, [192] on each occasion as a charity event raising funds for Sue Ryder's ""Manorlands"" hospice in Oxenhope . In September 2021, Finland 's first steampunk festival was held at the Väinö Linna Square and the Werstas Workers' House in Tampere , Pirkanmaa , Finland. [193] [194]
A 2018 physics Ph.D. dissertation used the phrase ""Quantum Steampunk"" to describe the author's synthesis of some 19th century and current ideas. [195] [196] The term has not been widely adopted.
A 2012 conference paper on human factors in computing systems examines the use of steampunk as a design fiction for human-computer interaction (HCI). It concludes that ""the practices of DIY and appropriation that are evident in Steampunk design provide a useful set of design strategies and implications for HCI"". [197]
Steampunk HQ , a museum and arts centre dedicated to steampunk in Oamaru , New Zealand , along with its associated art gallery ( The Libratory ), was the world's first steampunk museum. The town of Oamaru and the English city of Lincoln have both claimed the title of ""Steampunk Capital of the World"". [198] [199] [200]

The wait is finally over for one of the biggest nights in Hollywood.
The 95th Academy Awards will kick off Sunday, March 12 at 5 p.m. PT / 8 p.m. ET at the Dolby Theatre.
Aside from finding out which nominee will take home an Oscar, the star-studded night is expected to have several memorable moments, including the highly anticipated opening monologue by host Jimmy Kimmel and performances by Rihanna, Sofia Carson, Diane Warren and David Byrne.
Here's what to know before the main event.
Red carpet coverage will begin at 5 p.m. ET on E! and 6:30 p.m. ET on ABC. The E! live red carpet coverage will be hosted by Laverne Cox.

This year, the Oscars red carpet isn't going to be red, marking the first color change since 1961. Rather, stars will walk a champagne-colored carpet.
Red carpet creative consultants Lisa Love and Raúl Àvila were tasked to reimagine the carpet color, opting to break tradition so the talent could better transition from daytime arrivals to the evening, according to the Hollywood Reporter .
""This is about getting ready for the golden hour that follows the show,"" Love explained.
Kimmel told the publication that he's particularly excited about the newly-colored carpet, saying it's ""a remnant, we got it for a very good price downtown.""
The Oscar host also joked about how the new carpet would make it difficult for any unscripted drama to occur.
""People have been asking if there’s going to be any trouble this year, is there going to be any violence this year? I certainly hope not,"" he said. ""But if there is, I think the decision to go with a champagne carpet rather than a red carpet shows how confident we are that no blood will be shed.""
Hosted by Jimmy Kimmel for the third time , the 2023 Oscars are broadcast live from the Dolby Theatre in Hollywood in Los Angeles at 8 p.m. ET/5 p.m. PT, with the red carpet starting earlier . The 2023 Oscars are available to watch on ABC and various streaming platforms.

The Ohio River contributes more water to the Mississippi than does any other tributary and drains an area of 203,900 square miles (528,100 square km). The river’s valley is narrow, with an average width of less than 0.5 mile (0.8 km) between Pittsburgh and Wheeling (West Virginia), a little more than 1 mile (1.6 km) from Cincinnati (Ohio) to Louisville (Kentucky) and somewhat greater below Louisville.
The Ohio is navigable, and, despite seasonal fluctuations that occasionally reach flood proportions, its fairly uniform flow has supported important commerce since settlement first began. Following destructive floods at Johnstown , Pennsylvania, in 1889 and Portsmouth , Ohio, in 1937, the federal government built a series of flood-control dams. While not developed for hydropower in Ohio, the river, kept at a navigable depth of 9 feet (3 metres), carries cargoes of coal , oil, steel, and manufactured articles. It has a total fall of only 429 feet (130 metres), the one major hazard to navigation being the Falls of the Ohio at Louisville, where locks control a descent of about 24 feet (7 metres) within a distance of 2.5 miles (4 km).
The Ohio’s tributaries include the Tennessee , Cumberland , Kanawha , Big Sandy , Licking , Kentucky , and Green rivers from the south and the Muskingum , Miami , Wabash , and Scioto rivers from the north. Chief cities along the river, in addition to Pittsburgh, Cairo, Wheeling, and Louisville, are Steubenville , Marietta , Gallipolis , Portsmouth, and Cincinnati in Ohio; Madison , New Albany , Evansville , and Mount Vernon in Indiana; Parkersburg and Huntington in West Virginia; and Ashland , Covington , Owensboro , and Paducah in Kentucky .
René-Robert Cavelier, Sieur de La Salle , is said to have been the first European to see the Ohio, in 1669, and he descended it until obstructed by a waterfall (presumably the Falls at Louisville). In the 1750s the river’s strategic importance (especially the fork at Pittsburgh) in the struggle between the French and the English for possession of the interior of the continent became fully recognized. By the treaty of 1763 ending the French and Indian Wars , the English finally gained undisputed control of the territory along its banks. When (by an ordinance of 1787) the area was opened to settlement, most of the settlers entered the region down the headwaters of the Ohio.",source_text/55f4acebe4645c564a4616c205600388cda868d7357aca757e5b090dd1313c2a-neeva_0_2.txt,"Ohio River, major river artery of the east-central United States.

These are meant to indicate whether you want to go up or down, not whether the elevator must come up or down. For example, if you’re on Floor 3 and you want to go to Floor 7, you need to press the Up arrow button.
Why do elevators have 2 call buttons?
Two Call Buttons are used outside the Elevator to determine which Direction you’ll be going and to avoid the elevator reach maximum capacity by putting request calls on HOLD by preventing to halt on floors where the person wants to travel an opposite direction.
Which button do you press to call a lift?
If you are waiting for the elevator, there is sure to be an up and down button, depending on what floor you are on. If you are going up, push the top one, and when going down, push the bottom one. When inside the elevator, press the button for the floor you want to go to.
Call Buttons are used to request an elevator. They are mounted 42″ above the finished floor and consist of an up button and a down button that illuminate to indicate the request has been received and an elevator is on the way.
What happens when you press the call button in an elevator?
All elevators in the building have an Emergency Telephone Call Button built into their control panels. When the button is pressed, you are placed in contact with the building’s Security Operations Center.
How do elevators work buttons?
The buttons in the elevator car and the buttons on each floor are all wired to the computer. When you press one of these buttons, the computer logs this request. The computer varies the motor speed so that the car slows down gradually as it reaches each floor. This keeps the ride smooth for the passengers.
Button lifts work via an aerial steel loop that rotates on wheels and is powered by an engine. Attached are equally spaced poles hanging down and on the bottom of each pole is a button shaped plastic seat that is placed between the skier’s legs or under the snowboarder’s front leg and pulls them uphill.
What do the up and down buttons on an elevator do?
When multiple elevators are in use, the up and down (call) buttons serve to tell the system whether or not to stop an elevator at that floor. For instance, you are on the 5th floor and you want to go down.
How many call buttons do you need for an elevator?
In a building with two floors, you only need one call button. The system understands that you want to go to the other floor. If there are three floors, then the person on the middle floor might want to go up and might want to go down. If the elevator is already going to the wrong floor it will take three times as long to get to their destination.
You can cancel a floor selection on several types of elevators including OTIS, Mitsubishi Electric, and FUJITEC. Depending on the elevator model, you can try double-pressing the floor button (Mitsubishi Electric), quickly pressing the button five times (FUJITEC) or double-pressing the floor button while holding the “Open Door” button.
How do I put my Elevator into independent service mode?
Many older elevators can be put into “independent service” mode by pressing and holding both the Door Close and your desired floor buttons at the same time for 5 seconds. If successful, your elevator should go straight to your floor and bypass all other floors. I’ve tested it on multiple systems including older OTIS, DOVER, and DESERT models.",source_text/c4510924183e79ebca4ebd5e40db13d149ecdcf3483ef5d5dcd75300b744b896-neeva_0_0.txt,"The two buttons available to call an elevator have an up arrow and a down arrow.

Pressure cookers are a great way to cook food thoroughly and—most important—fast. This simple but brilliant device is essentially a kitchen pan on steroids with a lid that locks in super-high heat and pressure. It's a genius tool for the time-stretched.
Why Pressure Cookers Rule
Typically, anything made in a pressure cooker is ready in one-third of the time it would take with the stove top or oven. That's because of the intense steam and pressure built up in the airtight pan. And because of the quick cook time (we're talking an entire pot roast can be ready in about an hour! ), what you're preparing retains more of its original vitamins and minerals. Yet this unsung hero of the kitchen has earned a bad rap in the past (heat + pressure can be scary for some) and can be intimidating to the uninitiated. But our guide to the virtues of today's versions of the pressure cooker will make your crock pot jealous.
First Things First: Eliminate the Fear Factor
The pressure cooker is a time-saver and it's healthier—what's not to love, right? Well, this appliance has gotten a bit of a bad rap in past years. And partially rightly so. Yes, we've all heard the horror stories: Explosions! High velocity gusts of steam! Things flying across the room! But that is all in the past. Modern versions of pressure cookers ( a device that also led to the invention of canning foods) come with some safety measures to ensure they do not explode:
- The interlocking lid must be locked before the pressure will start to build up. Otherwise it's just a regular sauce pan.
- A sealing ring helps create an air-tight seal that won't allow steam to escape unless you press the safety valve or regulator (see: quick release below).
- The cooker comes with either an over-pressure plug and/or back-up vents to make sure things don't get too crazy in there.
Okay, now that we've settled that...
Learn the Lingo
With any new appliance, there may be a word or two (or three) introduced into your vocabulary. Here's a quick run-down of terms that will come in handy as you're getting familiar with all the bells and whistles of your new pan:
Quick release and natural release : Essentially, these terms refer to the way you release the pressure inside to open the pressure cooker when the food is done. You're either going to open the pressure release valve right away ( quick release ) or you're going to let the pressure drop naturally and gradually ( natural release ).
- Use quick release for any type of food that's just kinda done when it's done, like vegetables or eggs. In some cases, you need to use quick release to add food to the pot before you reseal it to resume cooking. Note: this will expel a locomotive-like stream of steam, so make sure it's pointed away from you or any people.
- Use natural release for meats that might benefit from a little simmer, or any other foods you want to stay toasty for a bit.
Pressure indicator : That's the little plastic piece on top of your lid that'll pop up when the correct pressure has been reached (think those plastic timers jammed into a grocery store turkey that pop up when the bird is cooked). It'll also fall when the pressure has dropped, indicating it's safe to open your lid.
Pressure release valve : You'll find this on the lid—this knob is what you'll use for that quick release we talked about above.
How Much Do You Fill Up the Pan?
Generally speaking, it shouldn't be more than two-thirds full of anything, but every model is a little different, so check your owner's manual for specifics on how much water you need to use and how much food you can cook in yours to avoid burning foods or plugging up the steam valve.
Pressure Cooker Recipes
You're used to certain conventional baking and stove top cooking times, so this new world might be a little disorienting. But—again—fear not! Reference the appliance's owner's manual to get some good rules of thumb for different types of foods. Also, use recipes: They'll send you in the right direction. We've got plenty of our favorites to get you started.
And for those living in wintery climates, these devices come with an added bonus: they create a cozy warmth in your kitchen as they simmer and whistle while they work.
You'll save SO much time using the pressure cooker that you can enjoy tender pot roast on a weekday evening. See how it's done:

"" My Country, 'Tis of Thee "", also known as simply "" America "", is an American patriotic song, the lyrics of which were written by Samuel Francis Smith . [2] The song served as one of the de facto national anthems of the United States (along with songs like "" Hail, Columbia "") before the adoption of "" The Star-Spangled Banner "" as the official U.S. national anthem in 1931. [3] The melody used is the same as that of the national anthem of the United Kingdom, "" God Save the King "".
Samuel Francis Smith wrote the lyrics to ""America"" in 1831 [4] while a student at the Andover Theological Seminary in Andover, Massachusetts . The use of the same melody as the British royal anthem can be described as a contrafactum which reworks this symbol of British monarchy to make a statement about American democracy. [5]
Well-known composer Lowell Mason had requested that Smith translate or provide new lyrics for a collection of German songs, among them one written to this melody. Smith gave Mason the lyrics he had written, and the song was first performed in public on July 4, 1831, [4] at a children's Independence Day celebration at Park Street Church in Boston. The first publication of ""America"" was in 1832. [4]
An abolitionist version was written, by A. G. Duncan, 1843, with lyrics mentioning white and black races. [6] For Washington's Centennial celebration, another verse was added to the original version. [7]
Marian Anderson performed the song at the Lincoln Memorial on Easter Sunday, April 9, 1939. Anderson, an African American singer, had been forbidden to perform at the DAR Constitution Hall due to its racist whites-only policy. After a national outcry, and with support from Eleanor Roosevelt , the concert was held on the steps of the memorial, and attracted a crowd of more than 75,000 in addition to a national radio audience of millions. [8]
Martin Luther King Jr. recited the first verse of the song toward the end of his famous "" I Have a Dream "" speech at the Lincoln Memorial during the March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom on August 28, 1963. [9]
Crosby, Stills & Nash performed the song on the first episode of The Tonight Show with Jay Leno that aired after the September 11 attacks in 2001. [10]
On January 20, 2009, Aretha Franklin sang the song at the first inauguration of Barack Obama . [11] At his second inauguration , Kelly Clarkson sang it. [12]

However, UBI has been proven to reduce poverty and income inequality, improve physical and mental health, lead to positive job growth and lower school dropout rates, and protect people from sluggish wage growth and low wages. Therefore, it is possible that all citizens should receive a basic income from the state.","A majority of U.S. adults (54%) oppose the federal government providing a guaranteed income, also known as a universal basic income (UBI), of about $1,000 per month for all adult citizens, regardless of their earnings or employment status.","A narrow majority of U.S. adults (54%) say they would oppose the federal government providing a guaranteed income – sometimes called a universal basic income (UBI) – of about $1,000 per month for all adult citizens, whether or not they work; 45% favor the proposal.
The idea of the government providing a universal basic income for all adult citizens draws broad and intense opposition among Republicans, but is generally supported by Democrats, according to a new Pew Research Center survey.
Nearly eight-in-ten Republicans and Republican-leaning independents (78%) oppose the federal government providing a universal basic income of about $1,000 per person, with 62% strongly opposed. A smaller share of Democrats and Democratic leaners (66%) favor a UBI, with just a third supporting the proposal strongly.
UBI was the centerpiece of former Democratic presidential candidate Andrew Yang’s campaign. Yang is scheduled to speak to the Democratic National Convention on Aug. 20 , shortly before Joe Biden accepts the party’s presidential nomination.
How we did this
There also are wide age, race and income differences in views of the government providing a universal basic income of about $1,000 for each adult citizen, whether or not they work. Adults under age 30 favor the government providing a UBI by roughly two-to-one (67% to 33%). There is far less support among older adults: 72% of those 65 and older oppose the proposal, while just 26% are in favor.
Majorities of Black (73%) and Hispanic adults (63%) favor the government providing a UBI, compared with 35% of White adults. And while the proposal draws broad opposition from adults in upper- and middle-income households, a 63% majority of those in lower-income households favor it.
In both parties, younger adults and those with lower incomes express higher levels of support for the federal government providing a UBI for all adult citizens. While majorities of Republicans across age groups oppose the UBI proposal, 41% of Republicans ages 18 to 34 favor it, by far the highest share of any GOP age group.
Among Democrats, support for a UBI also is much higher among adults ages 18 to 34 than among older people.
About four-in-ten Republicans in lower-income households (43%) favor the government providing a universal basic income, compared with 17% of those with middle incomes and just 8% of those with upper incomes. There are similar income differences among Democrats. Still, Democrats across income and age categories are far more likely than Republicans in those groups to favor a universal basic income.
There are also racial and ethnic differences in these views among Democrats, though majorities of Black (77%), Hispanic (70%) and White Democrats (61%) support the federal government providing a universal basic income for all adult citizens.
Note: Here are the questions used for this report, along with responses, and its methodology .
CORRECTION: (Jan. 5, 2021): In the chart “Young people favor a universal basic income by about two-to-one; much less support among older adults,” the label for the total “strongly favor” amount has been updated to 23% to correct a typographical error. This change did not affect the report’s substantive findings.

It can be frustrating if your previously toilet-trained cat seems to have forgotten their training, so you might be wondering how to retrain a cat to use the litter box. Just like toddlers, every kitten is different when it comes to toilet training. Some pick it up very quickly, while others take a little longer to get the idea!
If you rescue a senior cat or take in a feral moggy, they might not be familiar with a litter box, but the good is that older cats can be litter box trained. There are also a number of reasons why cats can suddenly go on strike from using their litter boxes, which can be a little frustrating as well as messy. But how do you retrain a cat to use the litter box? Is it the same principle as for kittens, or are there other considerations?
Occasionally, cats can suddenly stop using their litter box, which might lead you to think that they've somehow forgotten how to use one.
However, there are various reasons why cats can stop using their litter boxes including age, medical issues or sudden changes to routine.

Some older cats suffer from senility, so it could be true that they've forgotten where to find the litter box. Some might also be unaware that they're not quite aiming in the right direction.
Firstly, they might pass urine around the house or even near their tray if they have a urinary tract infection. This is partially due to the cat's need to pass urine frequently and urgently, but it might also be related to a desire to withdraw for more privacy while feeling a bit poorly.
Arthritis can also cause cats to be unable to get into their tray, or make it painful for them, leading them to blame the litter tray and avoid it in the future.
Stress can also cause cats to pass urine or feces outside of their litter box. This might be due to other cats or a new baby in the home, a house move, or anything else that disrupts your kitty’s routine.
If you adopt an adult cat, you might assume that they know their way around a litter box. However, that's not always the case. Cats who have previously been kept in a home with outside access may not have had the desire nor the necessity to use a litter box.
Equally, stray or feral cats will have been used to finding their own toileting area wherever they choose. So, for many cats, the litter box might be a distant or even a non-existent memory. It could also be that the cat has used a litter box before, but they are used to a different type of cat litter or litter box. After all, cats can be pretty fussy about these things!
The principle of training an adult cat to use a litter box is not that different from litter-training a kitten. It does require patience, though, as there are many possible factors to consider.
The good news is that a cat's natural behaviour is to dig around before going to the toilet, and bury their waste afterwards. Therefore, if you provide an area for them to exhibit this behavior they should instinctively seek it.
However, if your furry friend needs a little encouragement, try giving them a tasty treat after each successful use of the litter box as positive reinforcement. It's important not to punish or scold them for any failed attempts, though, since this could cause stress. The best approach is to ignore any little accidents altogether.
Before you leap into training, it's a good idea to work through the following steps to make sure that you've not missed anything:
Your cat might prefer a certain type of cat litter. Try different options to see if they are partial to clumping, non-clumping, clay, gravel, or wood.
Just like litter, cats might have a liking for a particular kind of litter box. For example, some might like a covered litter tray with a door, while others might feel restricted by a roof!
It’s always worth questioning whether your fussy feline might want a deeper layer of litter. If you’re being a bit stingy with the cat litter, this could be a cause of your cat’s reluctance to use the litter box.
We all know that cats are very clean animals, and they’re also very sensitive. Many cats won’t use a litter tray unless it is perfectly immaculate.
Despite wanting a clean tray, some cats are put off using their litter boxes by strong smelling disinfectants.
We all want privacy when we go to the toilet, and cats are no different. It’s worth placing litter boxes in quiet areas of the home where there’s minimal footfall. Don’t be afraid to try a few different places to see which your cat prefers.
Cats like choice, and they don’t like to share. So, always follow the rule of having one more litter box than the number of cats you have.
If your cat used to use a litter box but has recently stopped, it might not be sufficient just to run through the list above.
You may need to get your cat checked over by a vet to ensure they're not suffering from cystitis or a urinary tract infection. The vet can also give you advice on whether stress might be the cause of your cat’s sudden change in behavior. If they think that stress could be contributing, they could recommend calming diffusers or sprays as well as anti-anxiety medications.
With some patience and understanding, it’s very possible to retrain your cat to use a litter box. Cats are very clean animals and like to be able to bury their poop. Once factors like infections and stress are ruled out, you should be able to find the right litter box combination for your furry family member.",source_text/572a90e811cc4be1622e1addbbc7ee832529ff88ea8428a2a5a3fae8b6f85d42-neeva_4_0.txt,"We all know that cats are very clean animals, and they’re also very sensitive.

Specifically, ridges parallel to the finger.","Raised ridges in fingernails, specifically those that are parallel to the finger, can be caused by a variety of factors. Vertical lines on fingernails may indicate certain health issues stemming from compromised adrenal glands. Ridges in the fingernails could also be a sign of an underlying condition, especially if the ridges are horizontal. Some systemic diseases that may cause nail plate grooves to develop include rheumatic fever, malaria, pemphigus, Raynaud disease, and myocardial infarction. Nutrient deficiencies and stress can also cause ridges in the nails. It is best to consult with a healthcare professional for proper diagnosis and treatment.",Vertical lines on fingernails may indicate certain health issues stemming from compromised adrenal glands.,"While most of us associate vertical lines on fingernails with the aging process, this is not always the cause. In many of us, these lines tend to develop out of the blue and may stem from an underlying health condition often associated with adrenal fatigue. These different health conditions may affect your nail or nail bed in different ways, including the shape of ridges in your nails. Vertical lines on fingernails are the most common nail change and, in most people, considered harmless. Horizontal lines, however, could point towards much more harmful issues. But whatever type of lines you have, knowing the cause could help with prevention or addressing the issue.
You may find either vertical or horizontal lines on your fingernails . They may result from different health issues that need to be addressed.
The protein keratin makes up a large part of your nails, skin, and hair. But when your body is low in this protein, or zinc, calcium, and vitamin A, your nails tend to show this in the form of ridges occurring on your nails. If young or relatively young with vertical lines on fingernails, you could explore whether you have any of these deficiencies.
In older adults, vertical lines on fingernails develop due to a slowing down of cell production that should take the place of dead cells on the surface. This is a normal process that most of us encounter as we age. But no matter how old we are when this starts happening, if you experience additional symptoms like color or texture changes as well, it may point towards an underlying medical issue. Besides the vertical lines forming due to the aging process, nails could also become either thicker or thinner, begin to split, or you find they break easily.
Trachyonychia, a condition also referred to as 20-nail dystrophy and common in children with psoriasis, eczema, or other skin conditions, presents as vertical lines on fingernails often with a rough, pitted nails surface. You could also see a change in nail color ranging from brown to a graying white. Nails tend to become brittle.
Other health issues causing vertical lines on fingernails accompanied include iron deficiency anemia , rheumatoid arthritis, and peripheral vascular disease. The latter health issue could result in a heart attack.
But you do not only find vertical lines on fingernails that could result from underlying health issues. You also find horizontal lines on fingernails called Beau’s lines.
Whereas vertical lines on fingernails are lines stretching from the tip of your nail to the back of the nail, Beau’s lines run horizontally from side to side. These lines may indicate you suffer from diabetes, acute kidney issues, or thyroid disease. Some people who have undergone chemotherapy also experience this nail issue.
Vertical lines on fingernails or even Beau’s lines may also suffer from digestive issues, celiac disease, Crohn’s disease, or an injury to a fingernail bed.
The various health issues mentioned so far are all indicative of one underlying health issue: adrenal fatigue. In some cases, they contribute towards this health issue, and in many instances, they are a symptom. But whether a cause or a symptom, these health issues result from some form of stress on your body and your body’s response to the stress. As mentioned, many different health issues show horizontal lines on fingernails as one of their symptoms.
Adrenal fatigue usually results from prolonged stress that sees your body’s NeuroEndoMetabolic (NEM) stress response continuously function. This sees a constant demand for higher cortisol production accompanied by the persistent change or reduction in certain body functions. In the long term, the change or reduction in certain body functions together with the high cortisol supply sees not only your adrenal glands put under greater stress that may result in adrenal fatigue but other body systems and their functions compromised. This results in various possible health issues that are symptoms of compromised adrenal function. You may end up with some of the health conditions mentioned, as well as vertical lines on fingernails that are symptomatic of different specific health issues.
Even if vertical lines on fingernails develop when you are older, talking to your healthcare practitioner may still be a good idea. This is a precautionary measure to find out whether something else may be at play.
Sudden nail changes tend to be more alarming and you should seek the advice of a medical healthcare professional as soon as you notice them. You should also seek immediate medical attention if you injured your nail when it is crushed, you experience bleeding under the nail, it was torn off, or you have either a clean or ragged cut going through your nail. These may all cause an infection that could have some bad consequences.
Furthermore, for other possible causes of vertical lines on fingernails, your healthcare practitioner may ask you to undergo urine and/or blood tests. This is especially the case if they suspect you may have a nutritional deficiency or suffer from diabetes or kidney issues.
If your healthcare practitioner suspects they result from a skin condition, he may refer you to a dermatologist. The latter would take fingernail clippings and have them analyzed to find out whether you have an infection.
If your lines result from an underlying health issue, you may see an improvement in your nails when you treat the health issue. When a skin condition causes vertical lines on fingernails, topical eczema ointments and moisturizers may reduce these lines. And when your labs show you have mineral or vitamin deficiencies, taking supplements of making dietary changes may see the issue disappear.
Whatever the cause of the lines on your fingernails, you can also adjust things cosmetically by using an emery board to smooth the ridges. Do remember, though, that when your nails develop these lines, they may also be dry and brittle. So, do take care not to press too hard when filing them.
Besides addressing your underlying health issues and filing your nails to get rid of ridges, you could also supply some adrenal support.
Because many of the underlying health issues resulting in vertical lines on fingernails are of themselves symptoms of adrenal issues, providing adrenal support is a holistic way of addressing your nail issue. There is much you can do to support adrenal health, but it starts with making positive lifestyle and dietary changes.
Lifestyle changes include doing some gentle exercise daily, getting rid of or finding ways of controlling stress, and making ‘me’ time to get your thoughts in order and do something that makes you happy.
With regards to dietary changes, it would include cutting out sugary foods and drinks as well as processed and GMO foods. Instead, you would swap to a diet rich in omega-3 fatty acids , organic fresh fruit and vegetables, and lean protein sources. When anemia causes your problem, consider eating organ meats and spinach to help boost your iron deficiency. You could also explore the use of various natural supplements. When doing so, however, please consult your healthcare practitioner who will advise you of the benefits of the supplement, whether it is suitable for use depending on your stage of adrenal fatigue , and dose requirements.
While these dietary and lifestyle changes may not offer any cure, they do offer your body some much-needed support in addressing your adrenal health and thus, by association, support for the conditions your body may deal with.
If vertical lines on fingernails are an issue in your life, here are a few things you can do to help alleviate the situation.
- See your healthcare professional to find out the cause.
- Consider making lifestyle and dietary changes to support adrenal health and supply your body with the nutrients it needs to fight the issue.
- Moisturize regularly and gently file off the ridges with an emery board.
Do remember that your healthcare professional may ask you to undergo urine and blood tests to find the cause of these lines. Also, if considering supplements, please do so with the guidance of your healthcare practitioner who will assess the benefits of the supplement and recommend the correct dose.

The Museum of Science and Industry ( MSI ) is a science museum located in Chicago, Illinois , in Jackson Park , in the Hyde Park neighborhood between Lake Michigan and The University of Chicago . It is housed in the Palace of Fine Arts from the 1893 World's Columbian Exposition . Initially endowed by Julius Rosenwald , the Sears, Roebuck and Company president and philanthropist, it was supported by the Commercial Club of Chicago and opened in 1933 during the Century of Progress Exposition .
Among the museum's exhibits are a full-size replica coal mine , German submarine U-505 captured during World War II , a 3,500-square-foot (330 m 2 ) model railroad, the command module of Apollo 8 , and the first diesel-powered streamlined stainless-steel passenger train ( Pioneer Zephyr ).
The Palace of Fine Arts (also known as the Fine Arts Building) at the 1893 World's Columbian Exposition was designed by Charles B. Atwood for D. H. Burnham & Co. During the fair, the palace displayed paintings, prints, drawing, sculpture, and metal work from around the world. [2]
Unlike the other "" White City "" buildings, it was constructed with a brick substructure under its plaster facade.
After the World's Fair, the palace initially housed the Columbian Museum, largely displaying collections left from the fair, which evolved into the Field Museum of Natural History . When the Field Museum moved to a new building five miles north in the Near South Side in 1920, the palace was left vacant.
School of the Art Institute of Chicago professor Lorado Taft led a public campaign to restore the building and turn it into another art museum, one devoted to sculpture. The South Park Commissioners (now part of the Chicago Park District ) won approval in a referendum to sell $5 million in bonds to pay for restoration costs, hoping to turn the building into a sculpture museum, a technical trade school, and other things. However, after a few years, the building was selected as the site for a new science museum.
At this time, the Commercial Club of Chicago was interested in establishing a science museum in Chicago. Julius Rosenwald , the Sears, Roebuck and Company president and philanthropist, energized his fellow club members by pledging to pay $3 million towards the cost of converting the Palace of Fine Arts (Rosenwald eventually contributed more than $5 million to the project). During its conversion into the MSI, the building's exterior was re-cast in limestone to retain its 1893 Beaux Arts look. The interior was replaced with a new one in Art Moderne style designed by Alfred P. Shaw .
Rosenwald established the museum organization in 1926 but declined to have his name on the building. For the first few years, the museum was often called the Rosenwald Industrial Museum. In 1928, the name of the museum was officially changed to the Museum of Science and Industry. Rosenwald's vision was to create a museum in the style of the Deutsches Museum in Munich , which he had visited in 1911 while in Germany with his family.
Sewell Avery , another businessman, had supported the museum within the Commercial Club and was selected as its first president of the board of directors. The museum conducted a nationwide search for the first director. MSI's Board of Directors selected Waldemar Kaempffert , then the science editor of The New York Times , because he shared Rosenwald's vision.
He assembled the museum's curatorial staff and directed the organization and construction of the exhibits. In order to prepare the museum, Kaempffert and his staff visited the Deutsches Museum in Munich, the Science Museum in Kensington , and the Technical Museum in Vienna , all of which served as models. Kaempffert was instrumental in developing close ties with the science departments of the University of Chicago , which supplied much of the scholarship for the exhibits. Kaempffert resigned in early 1931 amid growing disputes with the second president of the board of directors; they disagreed over the objectivity and neutrality of the exhibits and Kaempffert's management of the staff.
The new Museum of Science and Industry opened to the public in three stages between 1933 and 1940. The first opening ceremony took place during the Century of Progress Exposition . Two of the museum's presidents, a number of curators and other staff members, and exhibits came to MSI from the Century of Progress event.
For years, visitors entered the museum through its original main entrance, but that entrance became no longer large enough to handle an increasing volume of visitors. The newer main entrance is a structure detached from the main museum building, through which visitors descend into an underground area and re-ascend into the main building, similar to the Louvre Pyramid .
In 1992, due to increased attendance, the museum started planning its underground parking lot, located in three underground levels below the front lawn. [3] Construction of the underground parking lot was finished in July 1998. [4]
For over 55 years, admission to the MSI was free, although some exhibits such as the Coal Mine and U-505 required small fees. General entrance fees were first charged in the early 1990s, with general admission rates increasing from $13 in 2008 to $18 in 2015. [5] [6] Many ""free days""—for Illinois residents only—are offered throughout the year. [7]
On October 3, 2019, the museum announced that it intends to change its name to the Kenneth C. Griffin Museum of Science and Industry after a donation of $125 million from the now former Chicago billionaire Kenneth C. Griffin . It is the largest single gift in the museum's history, [8] [9] effectively doubling its endowment. However, president and chief executive officer David Mosena said the formal name change could take some time, due to the complexity of the process. He also said part of the gift will go into funding ""a state-of-the-art digital gallery and performance space that will be the only experience of its kind in North America."" [10] Chevy Humphrey became president and CEO of the private, non-profit [11] museum in January 2021. [12]
The museum has over 2,000 exhibits, displayed in 75 major halls. The museum has several major permanent exhibits. Access to several of the exhibits (including the Coal Mine and U-505 ) requires the payment of an additional fee. [6]
The first diesel-powered, streamlined stainless-steel train, the Pioneer Zephyr , is on permanent display in the Great Hall, renamed the Entry Hall in 2008. The train was once displayed outdoors, but it was restored and placed in the former Great Hall during the construction of the museum's underground parking lot.
German submarine U-505 is one of just six German submarines captured by the Allies during World War II , [13] and, since its arrival in 1954, the only one on display in the Western Hemisphere, as well as the only one in the United States. The U-boat was newly restored beginning in 2004 after 50 years of being displayed outdoors, and was then moved indoors as ""The New U-505 Experience"" on June 5, 2005. Displayed in an underground shed, it remains as a popular exhibit for visitors, as well as a memorial to all the casualties of the Battle of the Atlantic during World War II. Guided tours of the submarine are offered for an additional fee. Near the U-505 there is both a Mold-A-Rama machine and a penny flattening device . Both have U-505 designs.
MSI's Henry Crown Space Center includes the Apollo 8 spacecraft, which flew the first mission beyond low earth orbit to the Moon, enabling its crew, Frank Borman , James Lovell and William Anders , to become the first human beings to see the Earth as a whole, as well as becoming the first to view the Moon up close (as well as the first to view its far side). Other exhibits include Scott Carpenter 's Mercury-Atlas 7 spacecraft and a lunar module trainer.
Located in the Henry Crown Space Center is a domed theater, considered to be the only domed theater in Chicago. The screen of the theater is made of perforated aluminum, allowing the speakers mounted behind the screen to be heard throughout the theater.
The ""FarmTech"" exhibit showcases modern agricultural techniques and how farmers use modern technology like GPS systems to improve work on the farm, and includes a tractor and a combine harvester from John Deere . The exhibit also showcases a greenhouse, a mock up of a kitchen showcasing how much of the food we eat comes from soybeans, and how we use cows, from energy to what we drink.
A transportation gallery is located on the museum's west wing, containing models of ""Ships Through the Ages"" and several historic racing cars.
""Future Energy Chicago"" shows alternative resources, housing developments, and the future of Chicago . The exhibit requires an additional fee.
Some areas in the museum aim for younger children, including the ""Swiss Jollyball"", the world's largest pinball machine built by a British man from Switzerland using nothing but salvaged junk; the ""Idea Factory"", a toddler water table play area; and the former ""Circus"" exhibit, featuring animated dioramas of a miniature circus as well as containing a shadow garden and several funhouse mirrors. The Circus exhibit was closed in September 2022.
Silent-film star and stock-market investor Colleen Moore 's Fairy Castle ""doll's house"" is on display.
Numbers in Nature: A Mirror Maze contains an interactive theater and stations to learn about patterns in nature, including the Golden Ratio, spirals, fractal branching, and Voronoi patterns. [14]
It also contains a mirror maze to help emphasize the geometric patterns that can be utilized.
The Transportation Zone contains several permanent exhibits.
The Great Train Story is a 3,500-square-foot (330 m 2 ) HO-scale model railroad and recounts the story of transportation from Chicago to Seattle . [15]
The museum includes a replica of Stephenson's Rocket , which was the first steam locomotive to exceed 25 miles per hour.
The 999 Empire State Express steam locomotive was alleged to be the first vehicle to exceed 100 miles per hour (160 km/h) in 1893, although no reliable measurement ever took place (and such a speed was likely impossible). [a] Designed to win the battle of express trains to the World's Columbian Exhibition , it was donated to the museum by the New York Central in 1962. The locomotive was located outside the museum until 1993, when extensive restoration took place and it was moved indoors as an exhibit in the Transportation Zone.
A replica of the Wright Brothers first airplane, the Wright Flyer , is on display.
Two World War II warplanes are also exhibited. Both were donated by the British government: a German Ju 87 R-2/Trop. Stuka divebomber—one of only two intact Stukas left in the world—and a British Supermarine Spitfire . Also on display is the museum's Travel Air Type R Mystery Ship , nicknamed ""Texaco 13"", which set many world records in flying.
""Take Flight"" features the first Boeing 727 jet plane in commercial service, donated by United Airlines , with one wing removed and holes cut on the fuselage to facilitate visitor access.
In March 2010, the museum opened ""Science Storms"" in the Allstate Court, as a permanent exhibit. [17] This multilevel exhibit features a 40-foot (12 m) water vapor tornado, tsunami tank, Tesla coil , heliostat system, and a Wimshurst machine built by James Wimshurst in the late 19th century. Also housed are Newton's Cradle , the color spectrum , and Foucault pendulum . All artifacts allow guests to explore the physics and chemistry of the natural world. [18]
In keeping with Rosenwald's vision, many of the exhibits are interactive. ""Genetics: Decoding Life,"" looks at how genetics affect human and animal development as well as containing a chick hatchery composed of an incubator where baby chickens hatch from their eggs and a chick pen for those that have already hatched, as well as housing genetically modified frogs, mice, and drought resistant plants.
The chick hatchery has been part of the museum since 1956. [19] About 20 chicks are hatched a day, around 140 hatch in a week, and up to 8000 hatch in a year. A week after emerging from their shells, the chicks are sent to the Lincoln Park Zoo to be fed to various animals, including lions, crocodiles, snakes, vultures, owls and tigers. This partnership between the museum and the zoo has been operating for decades, with about 7000 chicks being sent to the zoo each year. Some of the chicks hatched are of the Java species of chicken, and these chicks are sent to a farm in La Fox , Illinois that works to preserve the rare breed. [20] [21] There have been numerous efforts to shut down the exhibit, as early as 1998 and as recent as 2017. [22]
""ToyMaker 3000"", is a working assembly line which lets visitors order a toy top and watch as it is made. The interactive "" Fab Lab MSI "" is intended as an interactive lab where members can ""build anything"".
The ""Coal Mine"" re-creates a working deep-shaft, bituminous coal mine inside the museum's Central Pavilion, using original equipment from Old Ben #17, circa 1933. It is one of the oldest exhibits at the museum. In this unique exhibit, visitors go underground and ride a mine train to different parts of the mine and learn the basics of its operation. The experience takes around 30 minutes and requires an additional fee. [23]
""Yesterday's Main Street"" is a mock-up of a Chicago street from the early 20th century, complete with a cobblestone roadway, old-fashioned light fixtures, fire hydrants , and several shops, including the precursors to several Chicago-based businesses. Included are:
- Chicago Post Office
- Finnigan's Ice Cream Parlor and Photo Studio
- Gossard Corset Shop
- Jenner and Block Law office
- Lytton's Clothing Store
- Dr. John B. Murphy's office
- Walgreens Drug Company
Unlike the other shops, Finnigan's Ice Cream Parlor and The Nickelodeon Cinema can be entered and are functional. Finnigan's serves an assortment of ice cream and The Cinema plays short silent films throughout the day.
In spring 2013, the ""Art of the Bicycle"" exhibit opened, showcasing the history of the bicycle and how modern bikes continue to evolve.
""Reusable City"" focuses on recycling and other methods that could cut down harmful pollution and especially climate change and the Regenstein Hall of Science, containing a giant periodic table of the elements . Other main level exhibits include: ""Fast Forward"", which features some aspects of how technology will change in the future; ""Earth Revealed"", featuring a ""Science on a Sphere"" holographic globe; and a ""Whispering Gallery"".
The museum is also known for unique and quirky permanent exhibits, such as a walk-through model of the human heart , which was removed in 2009 [24] for the construction of ""YOU! the Experience"", [25] which replaced it with a 13-foot-tall (4.0 m), interactive, 3D heart. [26] Also well known are the ""Body Slices"" (two cadavers exhibited in 1 ⁄ 2 -inch-thick (13 mm) slices) in the exhibit.
Several US Navy warship models are also on display in the museum, and flight simulators including of the new F-35 Lightning II are featured.
An F-104 Starfighter on loan to MSI from the US Air Force since 1978 was sent to the Mid-America Air Museum in Liberal, Kansas , in 1993.
In March 1995, Santa Fe Steam Locomotive 2903 was moved from outside the museum to the Illinois Railway Museum .
""Telefun Town"", a hall dedicated to the wonders of telephone communication, sponsored by the company then known as ""The Bell Telephone Company"", no longer exists.
In addition to its three floors of standing exhibits, the museum hosts temporary and traveling exhibitions. Exhibitions last for five months or less and usually require a separate paid admission fee. [6] Exhibitions at MSI have included Titanic: The Exhibition , [27] which was the largest display of relics from the wreck of RMS Titanic ; Gunther von Hagens' Body Worlds , a view into the human body through use of plastinated human specimens; Game On , [28] which featured the history and culture of video games ; Leonardo da Vinci : Man, Inventor, Genius ; [29] CSI: The Experience ; Robots Like Us ; [30] City of the Future ; [31] Star Wars: Where Science Meets Imagination ; The Glass Experience ; Harry Potter: The Exhibition ; [32] Robot Revolution , which was sponsored by Google and featured numerous hands-on demonstrations and advice from experts for prospective future robot scientists and engineers; [33] and four installments of Smart Home: Green + Wired , featuring the work of green architect Michelle Kaufmann . [34] The Science Behind Pixar exhibit opened May 24, 2018. [35] The Wired to Wear exhibit opened on March 21, 2019. [36] [37] [38] The touring exhibit Marvel: Universe of Super Heroes officially opened to the public on March 7, 2021. [39]
Yearly, from late November to early January, the museum hosts its Christmas Around the World and Holidays of Light exhibit, featuring Christmas trees from different cultures from around the world. Started in 1942 with just one tree to honor soldiers fighting in World War Two, the tradition spawned into more than 50 trees.
- ^ Another contender is GWR 3700 Class 3440 City of Truro . The claim of the Empire State Express has little supporting evidence; unlike City of Truro , there are no timings showing the acceleration up to 100 mph. Some contemporary American technical journals doubted that such a high speed had been attained: ""Many are disposed to receive with doubt the statement that on 9 May the locomotive No. 999 of the New York Central railroad ran at the speed of 100 miles an hour, or that on a subsequent date she ran a single mile in 32 seconds"".

They will also be the first city to have hosted both the Summer (2008) and Winter Olympics.
Paris is set to takeover as host of the 2024 Summer Olympics . Milano Cortina and Los Angeles follow as the next winter and summer hosts 2026 and 2028, respectively.
When the Olympics return to the United States, the host country will have some experience under its belt. Let’s take a look at a timeline of United States cities hosting throughout Olympic history, and some major moments from each of those Games.
The United States has hosted the Olympics eight times throughout the Games’ history -- four Summer Games and four Winter Games. In 2028, the Summer Olympics will take place in Los Angeles, making it the ninth time that the U.S. has played host.
1904 Summer Olympics: St. Louis, Missouri
Chicago originally won the bid to host the first Olympics in the United States. However, organizers of the Louisiana Purchase Exposition (otherwise known as the St. Louis World’s Fair) in Missouri did not want another international event to occur in the same timeframe. So, the 1904 Olympics were forced to be moved to St. Louis and become part of the World’s Fair.
Watch all the action from the Beijing Olympics live on NBC
Various competitions were spread out over 4.5 months, and the 1904 St. Louis Olympics started the now-famous tradition of awarding gold, silver and bronze medals to winners of events. Boxing, freestyle wrestling, decathlon and a dumbbells event all made their debuts at the 1904 Games.
1932 Winter Olympics: Lake Placid, New York
In 1932, the small town of Lake Placid, N.Y., hosted the winter Olympics. More than 350 athletes from 17 countries gathered to compete in a Games officially opened by Franklin D. Roosevelt -- the then-governor of New York -- on Feb. 4.
The 1932 Lake Placid Olympics was the first time that a victory podium was used at the winter Games. Jack Shea -- a speed skater and Lake Placid local -- made history by being the first Olympian to be awarded gold on the podium, and by becoming the first athlete to win two gold medals at the same Games.
1932 Summer Olympics: Los Angeles, California
Given that the location was in a relatively remote region of California, and 1932 was the middle of the Great Depression, participation in the Los Angeles Olympics was the lowest since 1904 -- only half the number of athletes participated as those who did four years prior.
Despite the low attendance from athletes, a record American crowd gathered live to see the Opening Ceremony in the newly-constructed Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum. The Los Angeles Olympics were also historic for another reason: It was the first time in Olympic history that the Games were cut to just 16 days. Previously, competition had lasted 79 days.
1960 Winter Olympics: Squaw Valley, California
Squaw Valley put forward a bid to the International Olympic Committee in 1955 before the resort even existed. In fact, Alexander Cushing, a lawyer, was the only inhabitant and homeowner in the whole place when it was selected to host the 1960 Olympics.
The 1960 Olympics held a lot of firsts. It was the only Winter Games not to include a bobsleigh competition due to a lack of participation. Additionally, the Squaw Valley Olympics is where men’s biathlon and women’s speed skating made their debuts. It is also where French skier Jean Vuarnet became the first to win a medal using metal skis instead of wooden ones.
1980 Winter Olympics: Lake Placid, New York
Almost 50 years after Lake Placid’s first time hosting, the Olympics returned in 1980. It was the first Games to utilize snow machines to create artificial snow to ensure the best possible conditions for its events.
American speed skater Eric Heiden became the first person in Olympic history to win five gold medals in individual events at the same Games when he set records in all five speed skating events from 500m all the way up to 10,000m.
1984 Summer Olympics: Los Angeles, California
Los Angeles was the only city to bid, and thus picked, to host the 1984 Summer Olympics. After a United States-led boycott of the 1980 Moscow Olympics, the Soviet Union unsurprisingly organized a revenge boycott in 1984. Despite the 14 nations who stayed away, 140 National Olympic Committees took part, which was a record at the time.
The 1984 Olympics is where rhythmic gymnastics, synchronised swimming, the women’s cycling road race and the women’s marathon all made their Olympic debuts. It is also where the first paraplegic athlete took part in a medal event when archer Neroli Fairhall of New Zealand competed in a wheelchair.
1996 Summer Olympics: Atlanta, Georgia
A dozen years later, the Summer Olympics returned to the United States when Atlanta hosted the 1996 Games. For the first time in the history of the Olympics, all 197 recognized National Olympic Committees participated.
After the cauldron was lit by legendary boxer and activist Muhammad Ali , beach volleyball, mountain biking, lightweight rowing and women's football, along with the first women-only sport, softball, made their Olympic debuts. Athletes from a record-breaking 79 countries won medals at the Atlanta Olympics, and 53 countries took home gold.
Unfortunately, this historic Games was marked by tragedy when a terrorist bomb exploded in the Centennial Olympic Park, killing two people and injuring 110 more.
2002 Winter Olympics: Salt Lake City, Utah
The most recent Olympics to be held in the United States was in 2002 when Salt Lake City, Utah, hosted the Winter Games.
The Salt Lake City Olympics was a historic one for the Black community. American athlete Vonetta Flowers became the first Black athlete to take home a winter gold medal in women’s bobsleigh and Canadian ice hockey player Jarome Iginla followed as the first Black male winner.
2028 Summer Olympics: Los Angeles, California
The next time the Games return to the United States is for the 2028 Olympics in Los Angeles.
Originally, the winning bid for the 2028 Games was scheduled to be announced in mid-2021. However, after a number of cities withdrew from bidding for both the 2022 Winter Olympics and the 2024 Summer Olympics, the International Olympic Committee decided to jointly award the 2024 and 2028 Games in July 2017.
The 2028 Los Angeles Olympics will run from July 21 to Aug. 6. The 2028 Games have pledged to work towards being the first “Energy Positive Games,” meaning that it generates more energy through efficiency efforts and renewable sources than the energy needed to power the Olympics.
The first Olympics to be hosted in the United States was in the summer of 1904, making it the first time the Games were held outside of Europe.
It took some obstacles for the Olympics to eventually land in St. Louis, Mo. The International Olympic Committee originally considered Philadelphia and New York to be host cities and decided to award the 1904 Olympics to Chicago before it was ultimately moved to St. Louis to be combined with the Louisiana Purchase Exhibition.
The first city in the United States to host a Winter Olympic Games was Lake Placid. In 1932, a town in upstate New York with a population of fewer than 4,000 people was awarded the Olympics.
As the country faced an economic depression, Lake Placid Organizing Committee president Godfrey Dewey actually donated a plot of land for the construction of the Olympic bobsleigh track. It became pretty useful, too, when the Winter Olympics returned to Lake Placid in 1980.
Two cities in the United States have hosted the Olympic Games twice: Lake Placid and Los Angeles. Lake Placid hosted the Winter Olympics in 1932 and 1980, while Los Angeles hosted the Summer Olympics in 1932 and 1984.
The 2028 Los Angeles Olympics will be the city’s third go-around at playing host, making it the first North American city and the third worldwide to do so.
The United States has bid to host an Olympic Games 55 total times. Los Angeles leads all cities with 10 bids, followed by Detroit (7), Lake Placid (6), Philadelphia (4) and Chicago (4).
With its eight Games so far, the United States has hosted more Olympics than any other country. France has hosted the second-most with five Olympics. The U.S. and France will both add to their totals with the 2024 Paris Olympics and the 2028 Los Angeles Olympics.
The 2020 Tokyo Games was Japan’s fourth Olympics, and Italy will tie them for the third-most after the 2026 Milano Cortina Olympics.",source_text/cf0a99d64a4f1e7f55f70c716a1c90200b677f05c7390f08bb3472d1aaf90572-bing_chat_0_1.txt,"The most recent Olympics to be held in the United States was in 2002 when Salt Lake City, Utah, hosted the Winter Games.",complete_support,False,olympics - olympic - medals - held - games - usa - lake - winter - hosted - matches,StanfordCitation,0.76,0.6533333333333333,0.61,0.59,[0.9950525164604187],[0.9950525164604187]

About This Item:
Undeniably one of the greatest artists of all time, Michelangelo Merisi da Caravaggio would develop a radically new kind of psychologically expressive, realistic art and, in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, would lay the foundations for modern painting. His paintings defied tradition to such a degree that the meaning of his works have divided critics and viewers for centuries. In this original study, Troy Thomas examines Caravaggio's life and art in relationship to the profound beginnings of modernity, exploring the many conventions that Caravaggio utterly dismantled with his extraordinary genius. Thomas begins with an in-depth look at Caravaggio's early life and works and examines how he refined his realism, developed his obsession with darkness and light, and began to find the subtle and clever ambiguity of genre and meaning that would become his trademark. Focusing acutely on the inherent tensions, contradictions, and ambiguities within Caravaggio's paintings, Thomas goes on to examine his mature religious works and the ways he created a powerful but stark and enigmatic expressiveness in his protagonists. Lastly, he delves into the artist's final hectic years as a fugitive killer evading papal police and wandering the cities of southern Italy. Richly illustrated in color throughout, Caravaggio and the Creation of Modernity will appeal to all of those fascinated by the history of art and the remarkable lives of Renaissance masters.

On June 11, 2016, Nick Carter of the Backstreet Boys, who had become friendly with Florida Georgia Line, attended one of the duo's performances during the CMA Music Festival at Nissan Stadium in Nashville. After the show, they played some of their newly recorded songs on the tour bus for Carter, and Carter became interested in the song ""God, Your Mama, and Me"". The duo then asked members of the Backstreet Boys via their manager Seth England if the group would be interested in performing with them, and all five members of the group agreed. In the song, Carter sang on the second verse, AJ McLean and Kevin Richardson sang on the bridge, and Brian Littrell and Howie Dorough provided background vocals.

However, Hong Kong has a long history of being inhabited and was incorporated into the Chinese Empire during the Qin dynasty. The British acquired Hong Kong Island in 1842 at the end of their first war with China.",The British acquired Hong Kong Island in 1842 at the end of their first war with China.,"From Fishing Village to Financial Center
By JUDY LU KESTELL and HAROLD MEINHEIT
Hong Kong is a unique melding of Eastern and Western influences, whose history has made it a meeting point for China and the outside world. In this environment, Hong Kong's Chinese population, more than 95 percent of the former colony's residents, has developed a distinctive culture.
As one of the world's great cities, Hong Kong has many faces. To scholars and journalists, it was long the best place to play ""China-watcher."" To the business and financial community, Hong Kong remains one of the best places in the world to make money. To artists, writers and filmmakers, the city's colorful history and dramatic beauty have provided inspiration and vivid settings for art, books and movies. To tourists, it is a shopper's paradise with great restaurants and magnificent harbor views.
Hong Kong consists of Hong Kong Island (ceded by China to Britain in 1842), the southern part of the Kowloon Peninsula and Stonecutters Island (ceded in 1860) and the New Territories, which include the mainland area lying to the north and 235 offshore islands. The New Territories were leased from China for 99 years beginning in 1898.
At midnight on June 30, China took the territory back from Great Britain as a ""Special Administrative Region"" that, the Chinese government has promised, will retain its present economic and social system for the next 50 years.
How did this unique city emerge from a sparsely populated coastal area to become one of the world's most vibrant international centers of commerce? A Library exhibition, ""Hong Kong: From Fishing Village to Financial Center,"" tries to answer this question by tracing Hong Kong's development from the mid-19th century to the present, through materials from the Library of Congress collections.
Archaeological evidence of human settlement in the area of modern-day Hong Kong goes back to the fourth millennium B.C., although the identity of these early inhabitants is uncertain. Since the southern expansion of the Qin (221-207 B.C.) and the Han (206 B.C.-A.D. 220) dynasties, there have been Chinese settlements in the Hong Kong region; however, the area was never heavily populated.
When the British started using the excellent harbor on the northern side of Hong Kong Island in the early 1840s, they found more than 3,000 inhabitants in villages and 2,000 fishermen living in their boats in the harbor. The British started referring to the small, hilly, rocky island sheltering the harbor as ""Hong Kong,"" which comes from a local Cantonese dialect and means ""fragrant harbor.""
The British colony of Hong Kong was born from the clash between two great empires. The ostensible reason for the outbreak of war between China and Great Britain in 1839 was opium, which the British and other Western traders were importing illegally into China.
The roots of the conflict, however, went much deeper, growing out of two fundamentally different concepts of international relations and trade. In the face of Western pressures to open China to trade, the Qing dynasty (1644-1911) clung to the old tributary system and struggled to keep the West at bay. Resenting the Qing dynasty's disdain of foreigners, Britain and other Western traders demanded equal treatment and commercial access to the Chinese market.
Britain acquired Hong Kong Island under the Treaty of Nanking (Nanjing) in 1842 at the end of its first war with China. Friction between China and the West, however, increased in 1850 when a new emperor assumed the throne in Beijing, and it became clear the treaties were not being observed. Another war, fought between 1856 and 1860, resulted in Britain's obtaining the tip of the Kowloon Peninsula (on the mainland across the harbor from Hong Kong Island) and Stonecutters Island.
The commercial development of Hong Kong's fine natural harbor, which had attracted the British in the first place, began slowly, and Hong Kong lagged behind Shanghai as a port. With the discovery of gold in California in 1849, however, Hong Kong became a center for Chinese emigration from Guangdong Province to the United States, helping to build Hong Kong's economy, as many of the Chinese who went to California returned with their new-found riches.
By the last quarter of the 19th century, Hong Kong had developed as a British Crown Colony. The 1880s and 1890s were the heyday of colonialism in Asia, and colonial society in Hong Kong reflected the temper of the times. During this period, Hong Kong became an increasingly popular destination for western travelers in Asia. In 1879 Ulysses S. Grant visited Hong Kong during his two-year voyage around the world. Grant's official welcome united the former commander of the Union army with Col. John Mosby, the former Confederate guerrilla leader (who was representing the United States in Hong Kong), and Hong Kong Gov. Sir John Pope-Hennessy, in full imperial regalia. Hong Kong's elite society loved it.
One of the key developments of the 1890s was the construction of the Peak Tramway, an inclined-rail carrier that provided easy access to the top of Victoria Peak, the hill that dominates Hong Kong Island. Before the tram, the only way up was by sedan chair, carried by footmen. With easier access, ""the Peak"" became the most prestigious residential area of the colony, remaining so to this day. Hong Kong also gained in importance to the United States Navy when Adm. George Dewey used Mirs Bay, located on the eastern shores of the New Territories, as a staging area for his fleet during the Spanish-American War of 1898.
While British colonial society was flowering, important developments were taking place in the Chinese community. One of the most significant was the establishment of the Tung Wah Hospital in 1872. Beyond running a hospital for local Chinese, Tung Wah's Board of Governors soon started to play a broader leadership role in the Chinese community and functioned as an effective link to the British administration.
In 1887 the Hong Kong College of Medicine opened, and it provided an opportunity for the Chinese to obtain medical degrees. It also paved the way for another landmark event -- the opening of the University of Hong Kong in 1912. A second major university, the Chinese University of Hong Kong, opened in 1963.
The first half of the 20th century in Asia saw the birth of the Chinese revolution, growing anticolonial movements in the Southeast, and the rise of Japanese militarism, leading to the outbreak of World War II on the continent. Although not a major player, Hong Kong participated in the drama.
During the 1920s, increasing turmoil in China spread to Hong Kong in the form of a general strike in 1925 and a boycott of British goods that lasted until the fall of 1926. Hong Kong also provided a temporary base for Vietnamese revolutionaries such as Ho Chi Minh in early 1930.
By 1937, the Sino-Japanese War broke out and thousands of Chinese fled to Hong Kong, swelling the population to more than 1.6 million four years later. In December 1941, as it attacked Pearl Harbor, Japan attacked and occupied Hong Kong. Many citizens of the colony were imprisoned, and most had limited access to food and other resources. By the time the British returned at war's end in August 1945, the population had been reduced to approximately 600,000 residents.
During the 1950s, Hong Kong began its transformation to the modern economic success story of today. An influx of capital and entrepreneurial talent from Shanghai in the late 1940s and the Korean War trade embargo of China in 1950 spurred the colony's industrial development.
The 1950s also saw a worsening of Hong Kong's most serious social problem, a severe housing shortage caused by the influx of refugees fleeing the mainland. The development of public housing has been one of the Hong Kong government's major programs since that period, and today the squatter areas have largely disappeared.
With the formation of the People's Republic of China in 1949, much of the West was cut off from contact with the communist country. Diplomats, scholars and journalists based in Hong Kong used access to China's press, radio broadcasts, refugees and local contacts in the arcane art of ""China-watching."" For its part, China could maintain some contacts with the West through its unofficial representatives in Hong Kong at the New China (Xinhua) News Agency and the Bank of China.
Hong Kong was not isolated from Chinese domestic politics, however, especially during the Cultural Revolution of 1966-76. The Chinese government incited citizens of Hong Kong to protest British rule. The result was large-scale demonstrations against the colonial government, sometimes violent, during the spring and summer of 1967. The police handled the eruptions with firmness but restraint. Moreover, China did not force a confrontation with Britain and order was restored by that fall.
With President Richard Nixon's trip to China in 1972 and the establishment of full U.S. diplomatic relations with Beijing in 1979, Hong Kong's role as a ""China-watching"" post declined. However, its economic role grew dramatically as Chinese leader Deng Xiaoping's economic reforms began to take hold in the early 1980s.
As Hong Kong grew into an international financial center, its culture became a mixture of the East and the West. The local Chinese absorbed elements of Western art, fashion, food, music, entertainment, and consumer behavior, thus creating a colorful, modern culture unique in Asia.
Traditional Chinese arts have comfortably coexisted with Western-influenced ones. Writers in the local Chinese community have clung to the ancient history of China as a source of literary inspiration. Moreover, traditional Chinese opera, which portrays heroes and heroines from the ancient Chinese dynasties, continues to attract a large local Cantonese audience.
Although martial arts did not originate in Hong Kong, they became popular with large numbers of Chinese and were featured in novels and films. Hong Kong's vibrant film industry produces large numbers of movies that are popular there and in many overseas Chinese communities.
For much of the 20th century, Hong Kong has been ""a borrowed place living on borrowed time."" Worry about the future surfaced again in the late 1970s and early 1980s, when Hong Kong's business community started to express unease about the New Territories lease, set to expire in 1997.
Legally, commercial leases in the New Territories could not be extended beyond June 30, 1997. As the date approached, therefore, shorter and shorter leases would be necessary, providing less time for investors to realize profits. This would, many feared, begin to damage investor confidence in Hong Kong.
Under pressure from the business community, during Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher's visit to Beijing in 1982, Britain raised the issue of extending the New Territories lease. China, however, had long taken the position that all the 19th century treaties and agreements on Hong Kong were ""unequal"" and as such were not binding. Extending the New Territories lease was not an option, and Britain's discussions with China became serious negotiations over the terms of Hong Kong's return to China.

- The Congressional Budget Office estimates that the best-off 1 percent of American households saw their income before taxes nearly triple between 1979 and 2016.
- The Federal Reserve estimates that the top 1 percent of Americans hold slightly more wealth than entire the bottom 90 percent, and their share has been rising over time.
- Under current law, only two out of every 1,000 people who die are wealthy enough to trigger the estate tax – or about 1,900 estates in 2018.
Several Democratic presidential candidates propose to raise taxes on the rich to raise money both to pay for their spending agenda and to reduce income inequality. They argue that the people who have benefited the most in recent years should bear the burden of the cost of programs that help the rest of the population. In light of the widening gap between economic winners and losers, they would use the tax code to reduce inequality more aggressively than today’s tax code does, and they devote some of the revenues to fund programs that benefit less well-off Americans. They also point out that the average tax rate paid by people at the top has fallen. Opponents say the rich already pay at least their fair share of federal taxes, and warn that raising taxes will have unwelcome side effects on the economy such as less investment and slower economic growth.
What do we mean when we talk about rich Americans? There are the well-off: About 9% of the households in the U.S. have income greater than $200,000, and they get almost 45% of all pre-tax income, according to the Tax Policy Center . And then there are the really rich: the top 0.4% of households—about 700,000 in all—have incomes above $1 million a year and get 13% of all pre-tax income. Since the 1980s, those at the very top have enjoyed faster growing incomes than the rest of the America. The Congressional Budget Office estimates that the best-off 1% of American households (average annual income $1.8 million in 2016) saw their inflation-adjust incomes before taxes nearly triple between 1979 and 2016; the next best-off 9% saw theirs grow by 75% while everyone else saw their pre-tax incomes rise by 33%.
The rich generally pay more of their incomes in taxes than the rest of us. The top fifth of households got 54% of all income and paid 69% of federal taxes; the top 1% got 16% of the income and paid 25% of all federal taxes, according to the CBO. Some people argue that inequality is not as bad as some accounts suggest because they don’t take into account “transfer payments”—government benefits such as Social Security, food stamps, and the like—that are designed to help lower-income folks more than upper-income folks. Still, as the chart here shows, even after accounting for all federal tax and benefit programs, incomes of the top 20% rose faster than those of the rest of the population. And the after-tax-and-transfers income of the top 1% rose by 226% between 1979 and 2016, nearly five times faster than the incomes of people in the middle of the income distribution.
So if we wanted to raise taxes on the rich, how might we do it? Here are brief descriptions of a few of the proposals being discussed in the 2020 campaign:
Couples with taxable incomes (that is, after deductions) of $612,000 or more currently face a 37% tax rate on each additional dollar of income; those with incomes between $408,000 and $612,000 face a 35% marginal tax rate. In the several decades, that top marginal tax rate has fallen from 50% in 1986 to 28% in 1988 and risen as high as 39.6% just a couple of years ago. Democratic candidates often propose undoing the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act or otherwise raising the income tax rate on the best-off Americans. Raising the tax rate by one percentage point on the top two brackets would raise about $125 billion over 10 years, according to the Congressional Budget Office. Some Democrats talk of raising the top tax rate as high as 70%.
Advocates of raising the tax rates by one point see it as an administratively simple act that the top earners in the U.S. wouldn’t really feel that much, and that would result in a more progressive—and revenue-producing—tax code than we have today.
Opponents of raising the tax rates hold that higher tax rates can reduce the affected taxpayers’ incentive to work and save. They also can encourage taxpayers to shift income from taxable to nontaxable or tax-deferred forms (by substituting tax-exempt municipal bonds for other investments, for example, or by opting for more tax-exempt fringe benefits instead of cash compensation).
Income is different from wealth. Income is what you earn from your labor each year as well as interest, dividends, capital gains, and rents (if you’re lucky enough to have any). Wealth is the value of the things you own, such as stocks, bonds, houses, etc. The federal government taxes income, but generally doesn’t tax wealth except when someone makes a profit on the sale of assets, such as a share of stock or a piece of property. The Federal Reserve estimates that the top 1% holds slightly more wealth (31.1%) than entire the bottom 90% of the population (29.9%), and their share has rising been over time.
Senator Elizabeth Warren’s proposal would impose a 2% annual tax on households with a net worth of more than $50 million, and a 3% tax on every dollar of net worth over $1 billion. A family worth $60 million, for instance, would owe $200,000 in wealth tax on top of their income taxes. The developers of this tax, Emmanuel Saez and Gabriel Zucman of the University of California at Berkeley, estimate that 75,000 households—or about one out of 1,700—would pay the tax.
Advocates say a wealth tax would dilute the largest fortunes in the U.S. and restrain the emergence of a plutocracy. It could encourage the wealthy to dissipate their fortunes by spending the money, giving it to charity, or giving it to their children to avoid the tax. But even so it would still raise a lot of money. Saez and Zucman say Warren’s tax would yield $2.75 trillion over 10 years. Critics, including former Treasury Secretary Larry Summers, say that’s a substantial overestimate.
Opponents say that a wealth tax could discourage or penalize the most successful entrepreneurs, not just old money. And they say these sorts of taxes are hard to administer—the IRS would have to value art collections and antiques, for instance—and would spur creative tax avoidance. In 1990, a dozen countries in the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development had wealth taxes. Today, only three do—Norway, Spain and Switzerland. Opponents also note that wealth taxes often don’t meet the redistributive goals their proponents envision, drawing on a 2018 OECD report .
The estate tax is levied on the assets of the very best-off Americans when they die. The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act increased the level at which the federal estate tax kicks in so that the tax—at a rate of 40%—applies only to estates over $11.2 million. Only two of every 1,000 people are wealthy enough to trigger the tax when they die, or about 1,900 estates in 2018, according to the Tax Policy Center . Only 80 small farms and small businesses (defined as estates with farm or business assets of more than $5 million that make up at least half of the estate) paid the estate tax in 2017, again according to the Tax Policy Center . Estate and (related) gift taxes brought the government about $19 billion in 2019 , only 0.5% of all federal revenues.
One proposal would lower the threshold to estates worth $3.5 million (where it used to be) and impose graduated taxes depending on the size of the estate from 45% up to 65%. It would raise more than $300 billion over 10 years. Advocates of an estate tax hold that it is a good way to avoid dynastic wealth in the U.S. and make the U.S. a fairer place where merit matters more and the net worth of one’s parents matters less. As the wealthy get wealthier, they say, a stronger estate tax is increasingly important.
Opponents argue that the truly wealthy find ways to avoid the estate tax with high-priced lawyers and accountants before they die, and that the tax is simply unfair to those who want to pass along their hard-earned assets onto children—such as successful small business owners or independent investors, for instance. A tough estate tax can penalize people who invest in high risk, high-reward ventures that produce innovation and prosperity.
When someone dies with stocks, property or other assets that are worth more than he or she paid for them, the heirs do not have to pay capital gains taxes on those profits. No one does; the profits go completely untaxed. (In the tax world, this is known as “a step-up in basis”) Former Vice President Joe Biden, among others, has proposed taxing these profits. Heirs would have to pay tax when they sell the assets they inherit.
Social Security is financed by a 12.4% tax on wages, split evenly between employers and employees. This payroll tax applies to wages up to $132,900 in 2019. When Social Security began in the 1930s, about 92% of earnings from jobs covered by the program were taxed—but as wages have grown, the cap hasn’t kept up, so today about 83% of earnings are hit by the Social Security payroll tax.
One option is to raise the ceiling to $285,000 and adjust it annually so 90% of earnings are taxed, with an increase in the Social Security benefits these workers get in retirement. According to the Congressional Budget Office , this would raise $805 billion over 10 years. Advocates of lifting the cap say it will shore up Social Security finances so it can continue to pay all promised benefits beyond 2034, the year that Social Security trustees say the trust fund will run dry. Advocates also point to the fact that it would only affect higher-paid workers.
Opponents say this would cut cash wages to the affected workers—the more taxes an employer pays the less it will be willing to pay in cash wages, economists say. It also reduces higher-income Americans’ incentive to work while increasing incentives for employers to provide more untaxed benefits instead of cash wages.",source_text/bbdca559ba1bc167d1e681668af6f91252c2f12bf075b02892acebb219a9f315-perplexity_0_2.txt,"Many Democratic presidential candidates would raise taxes on the wealthiest Americans to reduce inequality, fund programs benefitting lower income households, and mitigate the amount of dynastic wealth in the U.S. However, those who disagree with these proposals argue they will have negative consequences, including less investment, slower economic growth, and more creative tax avoidance.",complete_support,False,song - sang - wrote - sings - movie - played - plays - blood - released - original,StanfordCitation,0.52,0.49666666666666665,0.51,0.46,[0.9948463439941406],[0.9948463439941406]

When you create new layers of abstraction between the thing or event, you are becoming more meta.
For example: A footnote that is needed to explain another footnote is meta.
The problem with being meta is that if you add sufficient layers of abstraction or complexity between the original event and the convenient abstractions you create to clarify or explain it, you eventually lose all connection to the original. Generally, you need no more than two or three levels in writing.
Too much meta in your writing leads to meta fog .
In writing, this means your writing sucks.

She was the breakout star of her debut season which was season 6.,She was the breakout star of her debut season which was season 6.,"By
From the inaugural season to the various reunion seasons and the introduction of Cardi B, find out which VH1 Love and Hip Hop seasons reign supreme.
After ten successful seasons in New York that ended in 2019, VH1 rebooted its flagship reality dating show Love and Hip Hop for a summer 2021 release. Moving to the popular city of Miami, Florida, where several of the spinoff shows took place, the newest season features the lives of several people involved in the southern hip hop, reggaeton, and Latin music scene.
RELATED:
What makes Love and Hip Hop: New York such an enjoyable show is the magnetic cast of characters, intensely dramatic conflicts, inviting locations, enjoyable music, and the way in which it can launch a budding artist's career. The question is, how does the new reboot compare to the series past 10 seasons set in the Big Apple?
Following the departure of original series stars Jim Jones and Chrissy Lampkin, Season 3 of Love and Hip Hop took a major hit in the eyes of most fans. Forced to recast, the show had to pivot and undergo major production changes, with Yandy Smith taking over Chrissy's starring role opposite her beau Rich Dollaz. The star power simply couldn't equate.
Despite the dramatic dip resulting from Jones and Lampkin's departure, high moments in the season came in Episode 4 when Olivia and Erica confronted one another and hashed out their long-held beef. The low moment? Probably the sex video Yandy and Mendeecees made for his birthday.
Season 8 of Love And Hip Hop saw popular rapper Remy Ma kick off the festivities with a Unity party. Unfortunately, the season quickly fell out of favor among fans when Yandy was caught speaking into an unplugged telephone that proved the show's fabricated storylines.
RELATED:
As a result, the ratings of Season 8 fell below 2 million viewers for the first time in four years. The season was also roundly rebuked for shoddy editing, poor storylines, and dull casting decisions. Thankfully, the season ended on a high note with Remy and Papoose's A Merry Mackie Holiday party where Fat Joe brought the house down.
Dubbed as a comeback season, the 9th edition of Love and Hip Hop marked the return of polarizing cast members Joe Budden and Cyn Santana after a four-year respite. With fellow returners Remy, Rich, Safaree, and Yandy, producers attempted to cash in on viewers' sense of nostalgia for the cast members.
While the theme of the season didn't resonate as well as some of the others, the highlight clearly came when the cast took a trip to Costa Rica that ended in an explosive row between Joe and Safaree before he proposes to Cyn. If that wasn't dramatic enough, Kim and Juelz rush to also tie the knot ahead of his prison sentence.
Dramatically improving over Season 3's lackluster ratings, Season 4 of Love and Hip Hop increased viewership by 54%, per thefutoncritic.com . A huge reason for the appeal was the return of Rashidah Ali as a guest star and the combustible love triangle between rapper Peter Gunz, Tara Wallace, and Amina Buddafly.
Other significant storylines that resonated with fans during Season 4 include Erica Mena falling in love with a woman for the first time in her life, and a frightening physical altercation between Saigon and his ex Erica Jean in front of their newborn son. The season had no shortage of drama, which is why it's one of the most adored reality dating series around .
In addition to the superstar power of such iconic names in the rap game as Cardi B, Remy Ma, Fat Joe, Method Man, Cam'ron, Noreaga, Lik Durk, and even the late great Michael K. Williams, Season 7 remains notably for the heated custody battle between Samantha, Erika, and Mendeecees. Things even got physical, requiring their mothers to get involved.
RELATED:
With extremely entertaining storylines across the board, Season's 7 biggest moments include Remy sacrificing her career to settle down with Papoose, Snoop, and her girlfriend J Adrienne physically fighting over the latter's bitter jealousy, and the dissolution of the creep squad.
As a newfangled novelty piquing the curiosity of VH1 viewers for the first time, it stands to reason that the inaugural season of Love and Hip Hop ranks among the upper-echelon of the pack. Indeed, the fresh premise was exciting enough to strike a chord among viewers of trashy reality television centered on catty infighting and argumentative dustups.
Focusing on Jim Jones and Chrissy Lampkin, the show did a nice job of pulling back the veneer of a rapper's public persona to air out all the dirty laundry behind the scenes. The best moment came in the penultimate episode when Chrissy tried to patch things up with Jim's mom but ended up alienating her even more. Revisit the beloved reality show on Paramount+ from season 1 to 10.
With the high-wattage star power of Cardi B shining bright for the first time, Season 6 of Love and Hip Hop is one of the most beloved so far. This is also due to the adored rapper Remy Ma and her husband Papoose joining the show fresh off her six-year jail sentence, marking only the third time in show history to undergo sweeping casting changes from one season to the next.
Aside from Cardi and Remy's natural charisma and high entertainment value that make the reality TV show one of the funniest of its kind, the Season also raised the profile of the popular social media rap group Migos, with Quavo and Takeoff appearing in the show. But beyond the star power, the best part of the season came during Remy and Pap's wedding ceremony full of emotional expressions and unforeseen family drama.
From Yandy welcoming Mendeecees home from jail at the start to their tearful wedding day in the end and everything in between, Season 5 arguably boasts the most satisfying character arcs in the show. And that doesn't even account for the riveting drama between Cyn and Erica that results in a shockingly violent end.
RELATED:
Beyond the two-hour wedding special that saw Yandy and Mendeecees finally tie the knot, the juiciest drama in Season 5 includes Peter giving Amina an engagement ring despite continuing to see Tara behind her back.
Call it recency bias, but the 10th season of Love and Hip Hop is still resonating among fans of the popular reality TV show . In addition to the fascination over how the production would handle the COVID-19 situation, the return of Jim and Chrissy following an 8-year absence brought flocks of loyal fans.
The emotional reunion of the original stars also included Joe and Tahiry taking their relationship to the next level, Safaree and Erica planning their drama-filled wedding, and Yandy's emotional time awaiting Mendeecees' release from prison. Most rewarding of all is seeing how far the main characters have come and how much they've grown, evolved, or failed to meet the challenges of maintaining love.
After ironing out all of the bugs and kinks from the first go around in Season 1, Love and Hip Hop Season 2 dramatically increased the overall entertainment value of the show. As such, the series averaged 2.8 million viewers per episode, making it the most-watched VH1 series in nearly four years (per thefutoncritic.com ).
A huge part of the appeal was picking up exactly where the first season left off, returning all of the original cast members in the process. Jim's mom releases a diss track against Chrissy, Emily leaves and reconciles with Fabolous, and Yandy introduces fan-favorite Kimbella Vanderhee for the first time, who soon strikes up a heated rivalry with Erica Mena.

Brigadier Usman, commander 50 PARA Brigade launched operations for clearing the enemy from Kot and captured Chingas on the road to Rajouri as the Indian army vanquished Pakistan.
Manekshaw who was the Army chief during the 1971 operation was the first Indian Army officer to be promoted to the rank of field marshal.
A veteran of the Burma campaign for the British forces in World War II, India's field marshal was involved in the Kashmir affairs during the contentious months of 1947 as the Maharaja signed the Instrument of Accession.
He was appointed as the eighth chief of Army staff on 8 June, 1969. ""Sam Bahadur"" as he was known in the Army, especially among his troops was credited with taking full strategic control of the Bangladesh operation under PM Indira Gandhi.
The Bangladesh war which lasted for 12 days in December was a monumental failure for the Pakistan forces with India taking 94,000 Pakistani soldiers resulting in the unconditional surrender of Pakistan and the birth of Bangladesh as a new nation.
Bangladesh became an independent nation, the world's fourth most populous Muslim state. Mujibur Rahman was released from a West Pakistani prison, returning to Dhaka on January 10, 1972 and becoming the first President of Bangladesh.

On December 12, 1971, the Indian Army captured Hardinge bridge, Khetlal & Madhupur. Narsingdi was built as a base to capture Dhaka.
The 1971 Indo-Pak conflict started when the Pak army conducted a widespread genocide against the Bengali population of the then east Pakistan.
PM Indira Gandhi expressed full support of her government for the independence struggle of the people of east Pakistan and decided to go to war against Pakistan after India's neighbour attacked.
During the war, the main Indian objective on the eastern front was to capture Dhaka and on the western front was to prevent Pakistan from entering India.
While India's grip on east Pakistan tightened, the IAF continued to press home attacks against Pakistan. The campaign then developed into a series of daylight anti-airfield, anti-radar and close-support attacks by fighters.
Hostilities officially ended on December 17 after the fall of Dhaka on December 15. India claimed large gains of territory in west Pakistan and the independence of Pakistan's eastern wing as Bangladesh was confirmed.

On the ground, Pakistan suffered the most with 8,000 killed and 25,000 wounded while India lost 3,000 and 12,000 were wounded. The loss of armoured vehicles was similarly imbalanced. It was a major defeat for Pakistan.
The ""Instrument of Surrender"" of Pakistani forces stationed in East Pakistan was signed at the Ramna Race Course in what is now Dhaka on December 16, 1971 by Lt Gen Niazi of Pakistan and Lt Gen Aurora of India.
For Pakistan, it was a complete and humiliating defeat, a psychological setback that came from a defeat at the hands of intense rival India.
Bangladesh became an independent nation, the world's fourth most populous Muslim state. Mujibur Rahman was released from a west Pakistani prison and he returned to Dhaka on January 10, 1972 and became the first President of Bangladesh.
The hero of the Bangladesh war passed away on 27 June, 2008 at the age of 94 at a military hospital in Wellington, Tamil Nadu and was buried in Ootacamund (Ooty).

NASA's budget is only 1% of the U.S. government spending, which is mostly allocated to social welfare programs. However, spending on space exploration can create highly skilled jobs, fuel technology advancements, and create business opportunities that can feed back into the economy, which can then be used to solve the world’s most pressing problems.","However, spending on space exploration can create highly skilled jobs, fuel technology advancements, and create business opportunities that can feed back into the economy, which can then be used to solve the world’s most pressing problems.","Most people who love space and believe in exploration have probably heard this once or twice: “We shouldn’t waste money on space exploration when there are problems to deal with here on Earth.”
While public health concerns, social injustices, climate change, and other urgent issues are important to address, solving these problems doesn’t depend on defunding space programs.
This can be a difficult conversation to navigate, so we’ve outlined a few ideas here that you can share when advocating for space.
Many countries around the world invest in space science and exploration as a balanced part of their total federal budget. Public opinion research has shown that people estimate NASA to take up as much as a quarter of the U.S. federal budget, but in fact, NASA’s budget only represents about 0.5% of the total federal budget and the proportion is even smaller for other spacefaring nations . The correct information may go a long way to reassuring critics that space spending isn’t eating up as many public resources as they think.
The United States government spent approximately $6.6 trillion in fiscal year 2020, of which just 0.3% ($22.6 billion) was provided to NASA. In this chart, shades of blue represent mandatory spending programs; shades of orange are discretionary programs that require annual appropriations by Congress. ""Defense and related"" includes both the Department of Defense and Veterans Affairs. Source: Office of Management and Budget Historical Tables 8.5 and 8.7.
If someone is arguing that public funds should be spent on solving the world’s problems, they should know that money spent on NASA positively impacts the U.S. economy . We get the same kind of payoff for space spending in other countries. Spending on space supports highly skilled jobs, fuels technology advancements with practical applications, and creates business opportunities that feed back into the economy. This in turn grows the pool of public money that can be spent on solving the world’s most pressing problems.
When people apply themselves to the challenges of exploring space, they make discoveries that can help the world in other ways too. Studying how we might grow food in orbit or on Mars yields insights into growing food in extreme conditions on Earth , generating knowledge that can help mitigate the impacts of climate change. Medical research conducted on the International Space Station helps us understand the human body in new ways, helping save lives and improve quality of life .
Studying the cosmos gives us an important perspective shift. When we learn about what lies beyond Earth, it gives us context for understanding our own planet. Studying the other worlds of our solar system and beyond makes it clear that Earth is a precious oasis for life. When we sent spacecraft to Venus we saw how a runaway greenhouse effect turned the world from a habitable planet to an absolute hellscape. When astronauts travel into space they see just how thin and tenuous Earth’s atmosphere is, appreciating the fragile balance in which we live . A cosmic perspective underscores the importance of protecting our planet’s habitability and encourages investment in that effort.
All the social and environmental progress in the world won't help us if an asteroid impacts the Earth. We have to explore space to find and study the asteroids and comets in our cosmic neighborhood if we want to make sure we can defend our planet if an object ever heads our way.
Not every child who dreams of becoming an astronaut will get that opportunity. This is a sad truth that many of us know from experience. But to be inspired to aim for something so grand gives kids the motivation to study hard and gain skills in science, engineering, medicine, or other fields that benefit humanity and directly help overcome problems that we face as a species.
And inspiration isn’t just for kids. When we marvel at the beauty of Jupiter’s clouds or the mystery of Enceladus’ oceans , we get an opportunity to appreciate the wonder and majesty of this cosmos that we inhabit. The idea that life might exist elsewhere in the universe reminds us that we might not be the only planet struggling to achieve balance, justice, and sustainability. And even in the bleakest of times, there’s something beautiful about still striving to achieve something great and discover something that could change how we see ourselves and our cosmos forever.
There’s no denying that there are many important issues facing humanity that need fixing. But to deal with those problems doesn’t mean we have to stop looking up, stop exploring, and stop making discoveries.
Human civilization has astonishing capacity, and we can do more than one important thing at a time. If someone thinks that a particular issue should get more attention and investment, they can and should advocate for that. The problems we face don’t persist because we’re spending money on space science and exploration. And there’s no reason to pit our aspirations against one another.

This can be thought of as a balloon being blown up, with stars and galaxies moving apart from each other more quickly, increasing the distance between them. The Hubble Constant sets the scale of the Universe, both its size and its age.",The universe is constantly expanding due to an intrinsic expansion whereby the scale of space itself changes.,"The expansion of the universe is the increase in distance between any two given gravitationally unbound parts of the observable universe with time. [1] It is an intrinsic expansion whereby the scale of space itself changes. The universe does not expand ""into"" anything and does not require space to exist ""outside"" it. This expansion involves neither space nor objects in space ""moving"" in a traditional sense, but rather it is the metric (which governs the size and geometry of spacetime itself) that changes in scale. As the spatial part of the universe's spacetime metric increases in scale, objects become more distant from one another at ever-increasing speeds . To any observer in the universe, it appears that all of space is expanding, and that all but the nearest galaxies (which are bound by gravity) recede at speeds that are proportional to their distance from the observer . While objects within space cannot travel faster than light , this limitation does not apply to the effects of changes in the metric itself. [notes 1] Objects that recede beyond the cosmic event horizon will eventually become unobservable, as no new light from them will be capable of overcoming the universe's expansion, limiting the size of our observable universe .
As an effect of general relativity , the expansion of the universe is different from the expansions and explosions seen in daily life. It is a property of the universe as a whole and occurs throughout the universe, rather than happening just to one part of the universe. Therefore, unlike other expansions and explosions, it cannot be observed from ""outside"" of it; it is believed that there is no ""outside"" to observe from.
Metric expansion is a key feature of Big Bang cosmology , is modeled mathematically with the Friedmann–Lemaître–Robertson–Walker metric and is a generic property of the universe we inhabit. However, the model is valid only on large scales (roughly the scale of galaxy clusters and above), because gravity binds matter together strongly enough that metric expansion cannot be observed on a smaller scale at this time. As such, the only galaxies receding from one another as a result of metric expansion are those separated by cosmologically relevant scales larger than the length scales associated with the gravitational collapse that are possible in the age of the universe given the matter density and average expansion rate.
According to inflation theory , during the inflationary epoch about 10 −32 of a second after the Big Bang , the universe suddenly expanded, and its volume increased by a factor of at least 10 78 (an expansion of distance by a factor of at least 10 26 in each of the three dimensions). This would be equivalent to expanding an object 1 nanometer (10 −9 m , about half the width of a molecule of DNA ) in length to one approximately 10.6 light years (about 10 17 m or 62 trillion miles) long. A much slower and gradual expansion of space continued after this, until at around 9.8 billion years after the Big Bang (4 billion years ago) it began to gradually expand more quickly , and is still doing so. Physicists have postulated the existence of dark energy , appearing as a cosmological constant in the simplest gravitational models, as a way to explain this late-time acceleration. According to the simplest extrapolation of the currently favored cosmological model, the Lambda-CDM model , this acceleration becomes more dominant into the future. In June 2016, NASA and ESA scientists reported that the universe was found to be expanding 5% to 9% faster than thought earlier, based on studies using the Hubble Space Telescope . [2]
In 1912, Vesto Slipher discovered that light from remote galaxies was redshifted , [3] [4] which was later interpreted as galaxies receding from the Earth. In 1922, Alexander Friedmann used Einstein field equations to provide theoretical evidence that the universe is expanding. [5]
Swedish astronomer Knut Lundmark was the first person to find observational evidence for expansion in 1924. According to Ian Steer of the NASA/IPAC Extragalactic Database of Galaxy Distances, ""Lundmark's extragalactic distance estimates were far more accurate than Hubble's, consistent with an expansion rate (Hubble constant) that was within 1% of the best measurements today."" [6]
In 1927, Georges Lemaître independently reached a similar conclusion to Friedmann on a theoretical basis, and also presented observational evidence for a linear relationship between distance to galaxies and their recessional velocity . [7] Edwin Hubble observationally confirmed Lundmark's and Lemaître's findings in 1929. [8] Assuming the cosmological principle , these findings would imply that all galaxies are moving away from each other.
Astronomer Walter Baade recalculated the size of the known universe in the 1940s, doubling the previous calculation made by Hubble in 1929. [9] [10] [11] He announced this finding to considerable astonishment at the 1952 meeting of the International Astronomical Union in Rome. For most of the second half of the 20th century, the value of the Hubble constant was estimated to be between 50 and 90 (km/s)/Mpc .
Based on large quantities of experimental observation and theoretical work, the scientific consensus is that space itself is expanding , and that it expanded very rapidly within the first fraction of a second after the Big Bang , approximately 13.8 billion years ago. This kind of expansion is known as ""metric expansion"". In mathematics and physics, a "" metric "" means a measure of distance, and the term implies that the sense of distance within the universe is itself changing .
On 13 January 1994, NASA formally announced a completion of its repairs on the main mirror of the Hubble Space Telescope allowing for sharper images and, consequently, more accurate analyses of its observations. [12] Briefly after the repairs were made, Wendy Freedman 's 1994 Key Project analyzed the recession velocity of M100 from the core of the Virgo cluster, offering a Hubble constant measurement of 80±17 km s -1 Mpc -1 (Mega Parsec ). [13] Later the same year, Adam Riess et al utilized an empirical method of visual band light shape curves to more finely estimate the luminosity of Type Ia supernova . This further minimized the systemic measurement errors of the Hubble constant to 67±7 km s -1 Mpc -1 . Reiss's measurements on the recession velocity of the nearby Virgo cluster more closely agree with subsequent and independent analyses of Cepheid variable calibrations of 1a supernovae, which estimates a Hubble Constant of 73±7km s -1 Mpc -1 . [14] Within the next decade, in 2003, David Spergel 's analysis of the Cosmic microwave background during the first year observations of the Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe satellite (WMAP) further agreed with the estimated expansion rates for local galaxies, 72±5 km s -1 Mpc -1 . [15]
The modern explanation for the metric expansion of space was proposed by physicist Alan Guth in 1979 while investigating the problem of why no magnetic monopoles are seen today. Guth found in his investigation that if the universe contained a field that has a positive-energy false vacuum state, then according to general relativity it would generate an exponential expansion of space . It was very quickly realized that such an expansion would resolve many other long-standing problems. These problems arise from the observation that to look as it does today, the universe would have to have started from very finely tuned , or ""special"" initial conditions at the Big Bang. Inflation theory largely resolves these problems as well, thus making a universe like ours much more likely in the context of Big Bang theory . According to Roger Penrose , inflation does not solve the main problem it was supposed to solve, namely the incredibly low entropy (with unlikeliness of the state on the order of 1/10 10 128 ) of the early Universe contained in the gravitational conformal degrees of freedom (in contrast to fields degrees of freedom, such like the cosmic microwave background whose smoothness can be explained by inflation). Thus, he puts forward his scenario of the evolution of the Universe: conformal cyclic cosmology . [16]
No field responsible for cosmic inflation has been discovered. However such a field, if found in the future, would be scalar . The first similar scalar field proven to exist was only discovered in 2012–2013 and is still being researched. So it is not seen as problematic that a field responsible for cosmic inflation and the metric expansion of space has not yet been discovered. [ citation needed ]
The proposed field and its quanta (the subatomic particles related to it) have been named inflaton . If this field did not exist, scientists would have to propose a different explanation for all the observations that strongly suggest a metric expansion of space has occurred, and is still occurring much more slowly today.
To understand the metric expansion of the universe, it is helpful to discuss briefly what a metric is, and how metric expansion works.
A metric defines the concept of distance , by stating in mathematical terms how distances between two nearby points in space are measured, in terms of the coordinate system . Coordinate systems locate points in a space (of whatever number of dimensions ) by assigning unique positions on a grid, known as coordinates , to each point. Latitude and longitude , and x-y graphs are common examples of coordinates. A metric is a formula that describes how a number known as ""distance"" is to be measured between two points.
It may seem obvious that distance is measured by a straight line, but in many cases it is not. For example, long haul aircraft travel along a curve known as a "" great circle "" and not a straight line, because that is a better metric for air travel. (A straight line would go through the earth). Another example is planning a car journey, where one might want the shortest journey in terms of travel time - in that case a straight line is a poor choice of metric because the shortest distance by road is not normally a straight line, and even the path nearest to a straight line will not necessarily be the quickest. A final example is the internet , where even for nearby towns, the quickest route for data can be via major connections that go across the country and back again. In this case the metric used will be the shortest time that data takes to travel between two points on the network.
In cosmology, we cannot use a ruler to measure metric expansion, because our ruler's internal forces easily overcome the extremely slow expansion of space, leaving the ruler intact. Also, any objects on or near earth that we might measure are being held together or pushed apart by several forces that are far larger in their effects. So even if we could measure the tiny expansion that is still happening, we would not notice the change on a small scale or in everyday life. On a large intergalactic scale, we can use other tests of distance and these do show that space is expanding, even if a ruler on earth could not measure it.
The metric expansion of space is described using the mathematics of metric tensors . The coordinate system we use is called "" comoving coordinates "", a type of coordinate system that takes account of time as well as space and the speed of light , and allows us to incorporate the effects of both general and special relativity .
For example, consider the measurement of distance between two places on the surface of the Earth. This is a simple, familiar example of spherical geometry . Because the surface of the Earth is two-dimensional, points on the surface of the Earth can be specified by two coordinates – for example, the latitude and longitude. Specification of a metric requires that one first specify the coordinates used. In our simple example of the surface of the Earth, we could choose any kind of coordinate system we wish, for example latitude and longitude , or X-Y-Z Cartesian coordinates . Once we have chosen a specific coordinate system, the numerical values of the coordinates of any two points are uniquely determined, and based upon the properties of the space being discussed, the appropriate metric is mathematically established too. On the curved surface of the Earth, we can see this effect in long-haul airline flights where the distance between two points is measured based upon a great circle , rather than the straight line one might plot on a two-dimensional map of the Earth's surface. In general, such shortest-distance paths are called "" geodesics "". In Euclidean geometry , the geodesic is a straight line, while in non-Euclidean geometry such as on the Earth's surface, this is not the case. Indeed, even the shortest-distance great circle path is always longer than the Euclidean straight line path which passes through the interior of the Earth. The difference between the straight line path and the shortest-distance great circle path is due to the curvature of the Earth's surface. While there is always an effect due to this curvature, at short distances the effect is small enough to be unnoticeable.
On plane maps, great circles of the Earth are mostly not shown as straight lines. Indeed, there is a seldom-used map projection , namely the gnomonic projection , where all great circles are shown as straight lines, but in this projection, the distance scale varies very much in different areas. There is no map projection in which the distance between any two points on Earth, measured along the great circle geodesics, is directly proportional to their distance on the map; such accuracy is possible only with a globe.
In differential geometry , the backbone mathematics for general relativity , a metric tensor can be defined that precisely characterizes the space being described by explaining the way distances should be measured in every possible direction. General relativity necessarily invokes a metric in four dimensions (one of time, three of space) because, in general, different reference frames will experience different intervals of time and space depending on the inertial frame . This means that the metric tensor in general relativity relates precisely how two events in spacetime are separated.
A metric expansion occurs when the metric tensor changes with time (and, specifically, whenever the spatial part of the metric gets larger as time goes forward). This kind of expansion is different from all kinds of expansions and explosions commonly seen in nature in no small part because times and distances are not the same in all reference frames, but are instead subject to change. A useful visualization is, rather than imagining objects in a fixed ""space"" moving apart into ""emptiness"", instead imagine space itself growing between all objects, without any acceleration or movement of the objects themselves. The space between objects shrinks or grows as the various geodesics converge or diverge.
Because this expansion is caused by relative changes in the distance-defining metric, this expansion (and the resultant movement apart of objects) is not restricted by the speed of light upper bound of special relativity . Two reference frames that are globally separated can be moving apart faster than light without violating special relativity, although whenever two reference frames diverge from each other faster than the speed of light, there will be observable effects associated with such situations including the existence of various cosmological horizons .
Theory and observations suggest that very early in the history of the universe, there was an inflationary phase where the metric changed very rapidly, and that the remaining time-dependence of this metric is what we observe as the so-called Hubble expansion , the moving apart of all gravitationally unbound objects in the universe. The expanding universe is therefore a fundamental feature of the universe we inhabit – a universe fundamentally different from the static universe Albert Einstein first considered when he developed his gravitational theory.
Main article: Comoving coordinates
In expanding space, proper distances are dynamical quantities that change with time. An easy way to correct for this is to use comoving coordinates , which remove this feature and allow for a characterization of different locations in the universe without having to characterize the physics associated with metric expansion. In comoving coordinates, the distances between all objects are fixed and the instantaneous dynamics of matter and light are determined by the normal physics of gravity and electromagnetic radiation . Any time-evolution however must be accounted for by taking into account the Hubble law expansion in the appropriate equations in addition to any other effects that may be operating ( gravity , dark energy , or curvature , for example). Cosmological simulations that run through significant fractions of the universe's history therefore must include such effects in order to make applicable predictions for observational cosmology .
In principle, the expansion of the universe could be measured by taking a standard ruler and measuring the distance between two cosmologically distant points, waiting a certain time, and then measuring the distance again, but in practice, standard rulers are not easy to find on cosmological scales and the timescales over which a measurable expansion would be visible are too great to be observable even by multiple generations of humans. The expansion of space is measured indirectly. The theory of relativity predicts phenomena associated with the expansion, notably the redshift -versus-distance relationship known as Hubble's Law ; functional forms for cosmological distance measurements that differ from what would be expected if space were not expanding; and an observable change in the matter and energy density of the universe seen at different lookback times .
The first measurement of the expansion of space came with Hubble's realization of the velocity vs. redshift relation. Most recently, by comparing the apparent brightness of distant standard candles to the redshift of their host galaxies, the expansion rate of the universe has been measured to be H 0 = 73.24 ± 1.74 (km/s)/Mpc . [17] This means that for every million parsecs of distance from the observer, the light received from that distance is cosmologically redshifted by about 73 kilometres per second (160,000 mph). On the other hand, by assuming a cosmological model, e.g. Lambda-CDM model , one can infer the Hubble constant from the size of the largest fluctuations seen in the Cosmic Microwave Background . A higher Hubble constant would imply a smaller characteristic size of CMB fluctuations, and vice versa. The Planck collaboration measure the expansion rate this way and determine H 0 = 67.4 ± 0.5 (km/s)/Mpc . [18] There is a disagreement between the two measurements, the distance ladder being model-independent and the CMB measurement depending on the fitted model, which hints at new physics beyond our standard cosmological models.
The Hubble parameter is not thought to be constant through time. There are dynamical forces acting on the particles in the universe that affect the expansion rate. It was earlier expected that the Hubble parameter would be decreasing as time went on due to the influence of gravitational interactions in the universe, and thus there is an additional observable quantity in the universe called the deceleration parameter , which cosmologists expected to be directly related to the matter density of the universe. Surprisingly, the deceleration parameter was measured by two different groups to be less than zero (actually, consistent with −1), which implied that today the Hubble parameter is converging to a constant value as time goes on. Some cosmologists have whimsically called the effect associated with the ""accelerating universe"" the ""cosmic jerk "". [19] The 2011 Nobel Prize in Physics was given for the discovery of this phenomenon. [20]
In October 2018, scientists presented a new third way (two earlier methods, one based on redshifts and another on the cosmic distance ladder , gave results that do not agree), using information from gravitational wave events (especially those involving the merger of neutron stars , like GW170817 ), of determining the Hubble Constant , essential in establishing the rate of expansion of the universe.

At cosmological scales, the present universe conforms to Euclidean space , what cosmologists describe as geometrically flat , to within experimental error. [23]
Consequently, the rules of Euclidean geometry associated with Euclid's fifth postulate hold in the present universe in 3D space. It is, however, possible that the geometry of past 3D space could have been highly curved. The curvature of space is often modeled using a non-zero Riemann curvature tensor in Curvature of Riemannian manifolds . Euclidean ""geometrically flat"" space has a Riemann curvature tensor of zero.
""Geometrically flat"" space has 3 dimensions and is consistent with Euclidean space. However, spacetime on the other hand, is 4 dimensions; it is not flat according to Einsten's general theory of relativity . Einstein's theory postulates that ""matter and energy curve spacetime, and there are enough matter and energy lying around to provide for curvature."" [24]
In part to accommodate such different geometries, the expansion of the universe is inherently general relativistic . It cannot be modeled with special relativity alone: though such models exist, they are at fundamental odds with the observed interaction between matter and spacetime seen in our universe.
The images to the right show two views of spacetime diagrams that show the large-scale geometry of the universe according to the ΛCDM cosmological model. Two of the dimensions of space are omitted, leaving one dimension of space (the dimension that grows as the cone gets larger) and one of time (the dimension that proceeds ""up"" the cone's surface). The narrow circular end of the diagram corresponds to a cosmological time of 700 million years after the Big Bang, while the wide end is a cosmological time of 18 billion years, where one can see the beginning of the accelerating expansion as a splaying outward of the spacetime, a feature that eventually dominates in this model. The purple grid lines mark off cosmological time at intervals of one billion years from the Big Bang. The cyan grid lines mark off comoving distance at intervals of one billion light years in the present era (less in the past and more in the future). Note that the circular curling of the surface is an artifact of the embedding with no physical significance and is done purely for illustrative purposes; a flat universe does not curl back onto itself. (A similar effect can be seen in the tubular shape of the pseudosphere .)
The brown line on the diagram is the worldline of Earth (or more precisely its location in space, even before it was formed). The yellow line is the worldline of the most distant known quasar . The red line is the path of a light beam emitted by the quasar about 13 billion years ago and reaching Earth at the present day. The orange line shows the present-day distance between the quasar and Earth, about 28 billion light years, which is a larger distance than the age of the universe multiplied by the speed of light, ct .
According to the equivalence principle of general relativity, the rules of special relativity are locally valid in small regions of spacetime that are approximately flat. In particular, light always travels locally at the speed c ; in the diagram, this means, according to the convention of constructing spacetime diagrams, that light beams always make an angle of 45° with the local grid lines. It does not follow, however, that light travels a distance ct in a time t , as the red worldline illustrates. While it always moves locally at c , its time in transit (about 13 billion years) is not related to the distance traveled in any simple way, since the universe expands as the light beam traverses space and time. The distance traveled is thus inherently ambiguous because of the changing scale of the universe. Nevertheless, there are two distances that appear to be physically meaningful: the distance between Earth and the quasar when the light was emitted, and the distance between them in the present era (taking a slice of the cone along the dimension defined as the spatial dimension). The former distance is about 4 billion light years, much smaller than ct , whereas the latter distance (shown by the orange line) is about 28 billion light years, much larger than ct . In other words, if space were not expanding today, it would take 28 billion years for light to travel between Earth and the quasar, while if the expansion had stopped at the earlier time, it would have taken only 4 billion years.
The light took much longer than 4 billion years to reach us though it was emitted from only 4 billion light years away. In fact, the light emitted towards Earth was actually moving away from Earth when it was first emitted; the metric distance to Earth increased with cosmological time for the first few billion years of its travel time, also indicating that the expansion of space between Earth and the quasar at the early time was faster than the speed of light. None of this behavior originates from a special property of metric expansion, but rather from local principles of special relativity integrated over a curved surface.
Over time , the space that makes up the universe is expanding. The words ' space ' and ' universe ', sometimes used interchangeably, have distinct meanings in this context. Here 'space' is a mathematical concept that stands for the three-dimensional manifold into which our respective positions are embedded while 'universe' refers to everything that exists including the matter and energy in space, the extra-dimensions that may be wrapped up in various strings , and the time through which various events take place. The expansion of space is in reference to this 3-D manifold only; that is, the description involves no structures such as extra dimensions or an exterior universe. [25]
The ultimate topology of space is a posteriori – something that in principle must be observed – as there are no constraints that can simply be reasoned out (in other words there can not be any a priori constraints) on how the space in which we live is connected or whether it wraps around on itself as a compact space . Though certain cosmological models such as Gödel's universe even permit bizarre worldlines that intersect with themselves, ultimately the question as to whether we are in something like a "" Pac-Man universe"" where if traveling far enough in one direction would allow one to simply end up back in the same place like going all the way around the surface of a balloon (or a planet like the Earth) is an observational question that is constrained as measurable or non-measurable by the universe's global geometry . At present, observations are consistent with the universe being infinite in extent and simply connected, though we are limited in distinguishing between simple and more complicated proposals by cosmological horizons . The universe could be infinite in extent or it could be finite; but the evidence that leads to the inflationary model of the early universe also implies that the ""total universe"" is much larger than the observable universe , and so any edges or exotic geometries or topologies would not be directly observable as light has not reached scales on which such aspects of the universe, if they exist, are still allowed. For all intents and purposes, it is safe to assume that the universe is infinite in spatial extent, without edge or strange connectedness. [26]
Regardless of the overall shape of the universe, the question of what the universe is expanding into is one that does not require an answer according to the theories that describe the expansion; the way we define space in our universe in no way requires additional exterior space into which it can expand since an expansion of an infinite expanse can happen without changing the infinite extent of the expanse. All that is certain is that the manifold of space in which we live simply has the property that the distances between objects are getting larger as time goes on. This only implies the simple observational consequences associated with the metric expansion explored below. No ""outside"" or embedding in hyperspace is required for an expansion to occur. The visualizations often seen of the universe growing as a bubble into nothingness are misleading in that respect. There is no reason to believe there is anything ""outside"" of the expanding universe into which the universe expands.
Even if the overall spatial extent is infinite and thus the universe cannot get any ""larger"", we still say that space is expanding because, locally, the characteristic distance between objects is increasing. As an infinite space grows, it remains infinite.
Despite being extremely dense when very young and during part of its early expansion – far denser than is usually required to form a black hole – the universe did not re-collapse into a black hole. This is because commonly used calculations for gravitational collapse are usually based upon objects of relatively constant size, such as stars , and do not apply to rapidly expanding space such as the Big Bang.
The expansion of space is sometimes described as a force that acts to push objects apart. Though this is an accurate description of the effect of the cosmological constant , it is not an accurate picture of the phenomenon of expansion in general. [27]
In addition to slowing the overall expansion, gravity causes local clumping of matter into stars and galaxies. Once objects are formed and bound by gravity, they ""drop out"" of the expansion and do not subsequently expand under the influence of the cosmological metric, there being no force compelling them to do so.
There is no difference between the inertial expansion of the universe and the inertial separation of nearby objects in a vacuum; the former is simply a large-scale extrapolation of the latter.
Once objects are bound by gravity, they no longer recede from each other. Thus, the Andromeda galaxy, which is bound to the Milky Way galaxy, is actually falling towards us and is not expanding away. Within the Local Group , the gravitational interactions have changed the inertial patterns of objects such that there is no cosmological expansion taking place. Once one goes beyond the Local Group, the inertial expansion is measurable, though systematic gravitational effects imply that larger and larger parts of space will eventually fall out of the "" Hubble Flow "" and end up as bound, non-expanding objects up to the scales of superclusters of galaxies. We can predict such future events by knowing the precise way the Hubble Flow is changing as well as the masses of the objects to which we are being gravitationally pulled. Currently, the Local Group is being gravitationally pulled towards either the Shapley Supercluster or the "" Great Attractor "" with which, if dark energy were not acting, we would eventually merge and no longer see expand away from us after such a time.
A consequence of metric expansion being due to inertial motion is that a uniform local ""explosion"" of matter into a vacuum can be locally described by the FLRW geometry , the same geometry that describes the expansion of the universe as a whole and was also the basis for the simpler Milne universe , which ignores the effects of gravity. In particular, general relativity predicts that light will move at the speed c with respect to the local motion of the exploding matter, a phenomenon analogous to frame dragging .
The situation changes somewhat with the introduction of dark energy or a cosmological constant. A cosmological constant due to a vacuum energy density has the effect of adding a repulsive force between objects that is proportional (not inversely proportional) to distance. Unlike inertia it actively ""pulls"" on objects that have clumped together under the influence of gravity, and even on individual atoms. However, this does not cause the objects to grow steadily or to disintegrate; unless they are very weakly bound, they will simply settle into an equilibrium state that is slightly (undetectably) larger than it would otherwise have been. As the universe expands and the matter in it thins, the gravitational attraction decreases (since it is proportional to the density), while the cosmological repulsion increases. Thus, the ultimate fate of the ΛCDM universe is a near vacuum expanding at an ever-increasing rate under the influence of the cosmological constant. However, the only locally visible effect of the accelerating expansion is the disappearance (by runaway redshift ) of distant galaxies. Gravitationally bound objects like the Milky Way do not expand and the Andromeda galaxy is moving fast enough towards us that it will still merge with the Milky Way in 3 billion years time. It is also likely that the merged supergalaxy that forms will eventually fall in and merge with the nearby Virgo Cluster . However, galaxies lying farther away from this will recede away at ever-increasing speed and be redshifted out of our range of visibility.
At the end of the early universe's inflationary period , all the matter and energy in the universe was set on an inertial trajectory consistent with the equivalence principle and Einstein's general theory of relativity and this is when the precise and regular form of the universe's expansion had its origin (that is, matter in the universe is separating because it was separating in the past due to the inflaton field ). [ citation needed ]
While special relativity prohibits objects from moving faster than light with respect to a local reference frame where spacetime can be treated as flat and unchanging , it does not apply to situations where spacetime curvature or evolution in time become important. These situations are described by general relativity , which allows the separation between two distant objects to increase faster than the speed of light, although the definition of ""distance"" here is somewhat different from that used in an inertial frame. The definition of distance used here is the summation or integration of local comoving distances , all done at constant local proper time. For example, galaxies that are farther than the Hubble radius , approximately 4.5 gigaparsecs or 14.7 billion light-years , away from us have a recession speed that is faster than the speed of light . Visibility of these objects depends on the exact expansion history of the universe. Light that is emitted today from galaxies beyond the more-distant cosmological event horizon , about 5 gigaparsecs or 16 billion light-years, will never reach us, although we can still see the light that these galaxies emitted in the past. Because of the high rate of expansion, it is also possible for a distance between two objects to be greater than the value calculated by multiplying the speed of light by the age of the universe. These details are a frequent source of confusion among amateurs and even professional physicists. [28] Due to the non-intuitive nature of the subject and what has been described by some as ""careless"" choices of wording, certain descriptions of the metric expansion of space and the misconceptions to which such descriptions can lead are an ongoing subject of discussion within the fields of education and communication of scientific concepts. [29] [30] [31] [32]
At a fundamental level, the expansion of the universe is a property of spatial measurement on the largest measurable scales of our universe. The distances between cosmologically relevant points increases as time passes leading to observable effects outlined below. This feature of the universe can be characterized by a single parameter that is called the scale factor , which is a function of time and a single value for all of space at any instant (if the scale factor were a function of space, this would violate the cosmological principle ). By convention, the scale factor is set to be unity at the present time and, because the universe is expanding, is smaller in the past and larger in the future. Extrapolating back in time with certain cosmological models will yield a moment when the scale factor was zero; our current understanding of cosmology sets this time at 13.787 ± 0.020 billion years ago . If the universe continues to expand forever, the scale factor will approach infinity in the future. In principle, there is no reason that the expansion of the universe must be monotonic and there are models where at some time in the future the scale factor decreases with an attendant contraction of space rather than an expansion.
The expansion of space is often illustrated with conceptual models that show only the size of space at a particular time, leaving the dimension of time implicit.
In the "" ant on a rubber rope model"" one imagines an ant (idealized as pointlike) crawling at a constant speed on a perfectly elastic rope that is constantly stretching. If we stretch the rope in accordance with the ΛCDM scale factor and think of the ant's speed as the speed of light, then this analogy is numerically accurate – the ant's position over time will match the path of the red line on the embedding diagram above.
In the ""rubber sheet model"" one replaces the rope with a flat two-dimensional rubber sheet that expands uniformly in all directions. The addition of a second spatial dimension raises the possibility of showing local perturbations of the spatial geometry by local curvature in the sheet.
In the ""balloon model"" the flat sheet is replaced by a spherical balloon that is inflated from an initial size of zero (representing the big bang). A balloon has positive Gaussian curvature while observations suggest that the real universe is spatially flat, but this inconsistency can be eliminated by making the balloon very large so that it is locally flat to within the limits of observation. This analogy is potentially confusing since it wrongly suggests that the big bang took place at the center of the balloon. In fact points off the surface of the balloon have no meaning, even if they were occupied by the balloon at an earlier time.
In the ""raisin bread model"" one imagines a loaf of raisin bread expanding in the oven. The loaf (space) expands as a whole, but the raisins (gravitationally bound objects) do not expand; they merely grow farther away from each other.
The metric expansion of space is a feature of many solutions to the Einstein field equations of general relativity , such as the Friedmann–Lemaître–Robertson–Walker metric and the Lemaître–Tolman–Bondi metric , where distance is measured using the Lorentz interval . This explains observations that indicate that galaxies that are more distant from us are receding faster than galaxies that are closer to us (see Hubble's law ).
The first general relativistic models predicted that a universe that was dynamical and contained ordinary gravitational matter would contract rather than expand. Einstein's first proposal for a solution to this problem involved adding a cosmological constant into his theories to balance out the contraction, in order to obtain a static universe solution. But in 1922 Alexander Friedmann derived a set of equations known as the Friedmann equations , showing that the universe might expand and presenting the expansion speed in this case. [33] The observations of Edwin Hubble in 1929 suggested that distant galaxies were all apparently moving away from us, so that many scientists came to accept that the universe was expanding.
While the metric expansion of space appeared to be implied by Hubble's 1929 observations, Hubble disagreed with the expanding-universe interpretation of the data:
[...] if redshifts are not primarily due to velocity shift [...] the velocity-distance relation is linear; the distribution of the nebula is uniform; there is no evidence of expansion, no trace of curvature, no restriction of the time scale [...] and we find ourselves in the presence of one of the principles of nature that is still unknown to us today [...] whereas, if redshifts are velocity shifts which measure the rate of expansion, the expanding models are definitely inconsistent with the observations that have been made [...] expanding models are a forced interpretation of the observational results.
Hubble's skepticism about the universe being too small, dense, and young turned out to be based on an observational error. Later investigations appeared to show that Hubble had confused distant H II regions for Cepheid variables and the Cepheid variables themselves had been inappropriately lumped together with low-luminosity RR Lyrae stars causing calibration errors that led to a value of the Hubble Constant of approximately 500 km / s / Mpc instead of the true value of approximately 70 km/s/Mpc. The higher value meant that an expanding universe would have an age of 2 billion years (younger than the Age of the Earth ) and extrapolating the observed number density of galaxies to a rapidly expanding universe implied a mass density that was too high by a similar factor, enough to force the universe into a peculiar closed geometry that also implied an impending Big Crunch that would occur on a similar timescale. After fixing these errors in the 1950s, the new lower values for the Hubble Constant accorded with the expectations of an older universe and the density parameter was found to be fairly close to a geometrically flat universe. [36]
However, recent measurements of the distances and velocities of faraway galaxies revealed a 9 percent discrepancy in the value of the Hubble constant, implying a universe that seems expanding too fast compared to previous measurements. [37] In 2001, Wendy Freedman determined space to expand at 72 kilometers per second per megaparsec - roughly 3.3 million light years - meaning that for every 3.3 million light years further away from the earth you are, the matter where you are, is moving away from earth 72 kilometers a second faster. [37] In the summer of 2016, another measurement reported a value of 73 for the constant, thereby contradicting 2013 measurements from the European Planck mission of slower expansion value of 67. The discrepancy opened new questions concerning the nature of dark energy, or of neutrinos. [37]
Until the theoretical developments in the 1980s no one had an explanation for why this seemed to be the case, but with the development of models of cosmic inflation , the expansion of the universe became a general feature resulting from vacuum decay . Accordingly, the question ""why is the universe expanding?"" is now answered by understanding the details of the inflation decay process that occurred in the first 10 −32 seconds of the existence of our universe. [38] During inflation, the metric changed exponentially , causing any volume of space that was smaller than an atom to grow to around 100 million light years across in a time scale similar to the time when inflation occurred (10 −32 seconds).
Main article: Comoving coordinates
In expanding space, distance is a dynamic quantity that changes with time. There are several different ways of defining distance in cosmology, known as distance measures , but a common method used amongst modern astronomers is comoving distance .
The metric only defines the distance between nearby (so-called ""local"") points. In order to define the distance between arbitrarily distant points, one must specify both the points and a specific curve (known as a "" spacetime interval "") connecting them. The distance between the points can then be found by finding the length of this connecting curve through the three dimensions of space. Comoving distance defines this connecting curve to be a curve of constant cosmological time . Operationally, comoving distances cannot be directly measured by a single Earth-bound observer. To determine the distance of distant objects, astronomers generally measure luminosity of standard candles , or the redshift factor 'z' of distant galaxies, and then convert these measurements into distances based on some particular model of spacetime, such as the Lambda-CDM model . It is, indeed, by making such observations that it was determined that there is no evidence for any 'slowing down' of the expansion in the current epoch.
Theoretical cosmologists developing models of the universe have drawn upon a small number of reasonable assumptions in their work. These workings have led to models in which the metric expansion of space is a likely feature of the universe. Chief among the underlying principles that result in models including metric expansion as a feature are:
- the Cosmological Principle that demands that the universe looks the same way in all directions ( isotropic ) and has roughly the same smooth mixture of material ( homogeneous ).
- the Copernican Principle that demands that no place in the universe is preferred (that is, the universe has no ""starting point"").
Scientists have tested carefully whether these assumptions are valid and borne out by observation. Observational cosmologists have discovered evidence – very strong in some cases – that supports these assumptions, and as a result, metric expansion of space is considered by cosmologists to be an observed feature on the basis that although we cannot see it directly, scientists have tested the properties of the universe and observation provides compelling confirmation. [39] Sources of this confidence and confirmation include:
- Hubble demonstrated that all galaxies and distant astronomical objects were moving away from us, as predicted by a universal expansion. [40] Using the redshift of their electromagnetic spectra to determine the distance and speed of remote objects in space, he showed that all objects are moving away from us, and that their speed is proportional to their distance, a feature of metric expansion. Further studies have since shown the expansion to be highly isotropic and homogeneous , that is, it does not seem to have a special point as a ""center"", but appears universal and independent of any fixed central point.
- In studies of large-scale structure of the cosmos taken from redshift surveys a so-called "" End of Greatness "" was discovered at the largest scales of the universe. Until these scales were surveyed, the universe appeared ""lumpy"" with clumps of galaxy clusters , superclusters and filaments that were anything but isotropic and homogeneous. This lumpiness disappears into a smooth distribution of galaxies at the largest scales.
- The isotropic distribution across the sky of distant gamma-ray bursts and supernovae is another confirmation of the Cosmological Principle.
- The Copernican Principle was not truly tested on a cosmological scale until measurements of the effects of the cosmic microwave background radiation on the dynamics of distant astrophysical systems were made. A group of astronomers at the European Southern Observatory noticed, by measuring the temperature of a distant intergalactic cloud in thermal equilibrium with the cosmic microwave background, that the radiation from the Big Bang was demonstrably warmer at earlier times. [41] Uniform cooling of the cosmic microwave background over billions of years is strong and direct observational evidence for metric expansion.
Taken together, these phenomena overwhelmingly support models that rely on space expanding through a change in metric. It was not until the discovery in the year 2000 of direct observational evidence for the changing temperature of the cosmic microwave background that more bizarre constructions could be ruled out. Until that time, it was based purely on an assumption that the universe did not behave as one with the Milky Way sitting at the middle of a fixed-metric with a universal explosion of galaxies in all directions (as seen in, for example, an early model proposed by Milne ). Yet before this evidence, many rejected the Milne viewpoint based on the mediocrity principle .
More direct results of the expansion, such as change of redshift, distance, flux, angular position and the angular size of astronomical objects, have not been detected yet due to smallness of these effects. Change of the redshift or the flux could be observed by Square Kilometre Array or Extremely Large Telescope in the mid-2030s.

Over 27,000 songs have graced the Billboard Hot 100 in the chart’s 60-year history. Of those, 1,077 have reached No. 1 — a select 3.8 percent.    
In honor of the Hot 100’s 60th anniversary, we’re looking at the best of the best, including the artists with the most No. 1s in the chart’s archives. More specifically, we’re highlighting the nine acts with at least 10 No. 1s each; call it the 10-Timers Club, if you will.

The list features seven solo artists and two groups. The Beatles, unsurprisingly, lead the way with a record 20 No. 1s, all earned between 1964 and 1970. The Fab Four also scored 34 top 10s (second only to Madonna’s 38), hitting No. 1 in over half their visits to the top 10.   
Notably missing from the list is Elvis Presley, who, in the Hot 100 era, scored seven No. 1s. The start of Presley’s career predated the Hot 100, which launched on Aug. 4, 1958, meaning that some of his classics, such as “Don’t Be Cruel,” “Hound Dog” and “Jailhouse Rock,” preceded the chart’s existence. He did, however, reach the summit with “A Big Hunk O’ Love,” “Stuck on You,” “It’s Now or Never,” “Are You Lonesome Tonight,” “Surrender,” “Good Luck Charm ” and “Suspicious Minds.”

While it has been said that we know more about the moon than the deep sea, this idea is outdated by 70 years.","Furthermore, only about 7% of the world's oceans are designated as marine protected areas, making it difficult to protect what we don't know.","© OCEANA/Juan Cuetos
Scientists have successfully photographed a black hole, landed rovers on Mars, and sent spacecraft to the dark side of the moon. Yet, one of the last unknown frontiers – and one of the most deceptively familiar – is on our very own planet.
More than 80% of the ocean remains unexplored. And because it’s difficult to protect what we don’t know, only about 7% of the world’s oceans are designated as marine protected areas (MPAs).
With this in mind, we explain why a body of water that covers most of Earth’s surface is also one of the most vulnerable – and least understood – places in the universe.
Under pressure
One of the biggest challenges of ocean exploration comes down to physics. Dr. Gene Carl Feldman, an oceanographer at NASA’s Goddard Space Flight Center, explains that the ocean, at great depths, is characterized by zero visibility, extremely cold temperatures, and crushing amounts of pressure.
“In some ways, it’s a lot easier to send people into space than it is to send people to the bottom of the ocean,” Feldman told Oceana. “The intense pressures in the deep ocean make it an extremely difficult environment to explore.”
Although you don’t notice it, the pressure of the air pushing down on your body at sea level is about 15 pounds per square inch. If you went up into space, above the Earth’s atmosphere, the pressure would decrease to zero. However, if you went diving or hitched a ride in an underwater vehicle, those forces would start to stack up the further down you went.
“On a dive to the bottom of the Mariana Trench, which is nearly 7 miles deep, you’re talking about over 1,000 times more pressure than at the surface,” Feldman said. “That’s the equivalent of the weight of 50 jumbo jets pressing on your body.”
Of course, human-occupied submersibles aren’t the only way to explore and study the ocean. We can even learn some lessons from space. Feldman specializes in satellite technologies that record the color of the ocean as a means of measuring the distribution and abundance of phytoplankton, which can change rapidly and even double in a day.
When these technologies were first used in the late ‘70s, satellites were able to capture detailed images of the ocean within minutes, while it would take a ship 10 years of continuous sampling to collect the same number of measurements, according to Feldman.
With that said, some things are better measured in the water – however difficult it may be to get there.
‘Bearing witness’
Ocean exploration technologies have come a long way. Floats and drifters, devices that rely on ocean currents to carry them while they collect data, have been complemented in recent years by an ever-sophisticated fleet of underwater vehicles. This can include human-occupied vehicles (HOVs), remotely-operated ones (ROVs), and autonomous and hybrid ones.
In a recent webinar hosted by the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution, film director and ocean enthusiast James Cameron called for an “all-of-the-above” approach, but also highlighted the value of continuing to plunge people into the great unknown. In 2012, Cameron set a record when he visited the Mariana Trench – the deepest part of the ocean – in a “vertical torpedo” sub.
“I call it bearing witness,” Cameron said. “There’s something very exciting about being physically present and using all of your senses. Plus, you can come back and tell the story, and that engages an audience. The most important aspect of exploration, in my mind, is coming back and telling the tale.”
Oceana uses a combination of technologies on its expeditions, which have charted previously unexplored waters, including areas off of Southern California , several seamounts in the Canary Islands , and a deep trench south of Malta . Another seamount near Morocco , which was also previously unexplored, led to the discovery of a deep-sea coral reef – the only one of its kind that is still growing in the Mediterranean Sea.
In Europe’s biodiversity hotspots , expeditions resulted in the first-ever record of a live brown-snout spookfish, as well as the documentation of two starfish species, one black coral, and one stony coral that were previously thought to only live in the Atlantic Ocean.
And in Chile, following Oceana expeditions which recorded the rich and unique marine life in the Desventuradas and Juan Fernández islands, the government was persuaded to make those places marine parks. A multiple-use MPA was also established in the Caleta Tortel commune following multiple Oceana expeditions.
While the benefits are undeniable, expeditions are expensive, and the lack of detailed maps and data make them all the more challenging.
Ricardo Aguilar, the leader of Oceana’s expeditions in Europe, said they can’t bank on bathymetric information – which can serve as a guide to an area’s underwater terrain – because in most cases it doesn’t exist.
“We only have good information on less than 5% of the world’s oceans, and maybe sparse information on another 10%,” Aguilar said. “Therefore, how can we protect areas where we have no clue what is there?”
Herein lies the catch-22: We need exploration to collect more information, but many agencies around the world are reluctant to fund projects where there are too many unknowns.
“There seems to be an increasing trend towards avoiding risk at all costs, which means that you often have to prove that you know all the answers before you can even start your investigation,” Feldman said. “But this is the wrong approach. Science is not only about having the answers. Science is really about asking the questions.”
Evidence, not excuses
Oceana has protected nearly 4 million square miles of ocean to date, and expeditions have been crucial to this success. Expeditions yield photographs, video footage, scientific data, and narratives that can all be used to bolster the case for new or expanded protections.
“By exploring previously unexplored areas, we have been able to discover new species and new habitats, but also to identify vulnerable habitats or threatened species that were protected ‘on paper,’ but because nobody knew they could be found in these places, there were no measures to effectively protect them,” Aguilar said.
“One of the most common excuses governments have used for not taking action is the lack of information to choose which areas to protect and how to manage them. Also, the opposition of different stakeholders to creating new MPAs was due to this lack of data.”
Oceana endorses plans to protect 30% of the ocean by 2030, a goal known as 30×30. While the world still has a long way to go, continued ocean exploration can supply the evidence needed to protect the ocean and the many resources it provides.
Even though data is useful, Feldman says a compelling case for MPAs can still be made when the reverse is true. Because scientists do not have a complete understanding of how one change to the ocean affects the entire ecosystem – and which of those changes may be the tipping point that causes collapse – it is common sense that areas should be designated for protection and further research.
“Since we don’t know how all the pieces fit together, setting aside areas where we just say, ‘We’re leaving these alone’ or ‘We’re going to have minimal intervention’ is perhaps the safest thing to do until we know better,” Feldman said. “The idea of setting aside areas that are environmentally important and unique is probably a really smart move until we can get smarter about how we manage the ocean.”",source_text/14cbaf6696e60c69021b3049807ce18785213733f6b07ebf414e9fdb4b8f8f3d-perplexity_2_0.txt,only about 7% of the world’s oceans are designated as marine protected areas (MPAs).,complete_support,False,ocean - moon - oceans - illuminated - explore - mars - underwater - outdated - floor - deepest,StanfordCitation,0.66,0.5599999999999999,0.53,0.49,[0.9678094983100891],[0.9678094983100891]

It is expected that the middle class will be the biggest beneficiaries of the “great wealth transfer” from the baby boomers. An inheritance can include cash, investment assets, real property, and items such as jewelry and furniture. The current inheritance tax rate in the United States is far too low, and is a major contributor to economic inequality. A fairer tax system would tax inheritances at higher rates than income from working, not lower.","Inheritance is a complex topic, with the Trump administration proposing tax breaks for those who receive large amounts of money, and the Biden administration proposing changes to generous inheritance laws.","Technically, Megan is a farming heiress.
Her mom grew up on a wheat farm, and for years, the government had been paying her family $15,000 a year to not farm. It was an attempt to keep land from being overused, and that money was basically the extent of Megan’s relationship with agriculture: the source of a yearly gift, the money she and her mom would wait for before, say, buying furniture or making home repairs. Now Megan, who asked to be referred to by a pseudonym to speak freely about her finances, receives that money directly.
In 2019, at the age of 64, Megan’s mother died. It was expected and unexpected. Her mom had been a cancer survivor for 20 years. But chemotherapy had damaged her heart, and two years ago, she went into cardiac arrest.
On the phone, Megan, 38, runs me through the process of settling her mother’s estate. It was a ton of bureaucracy: so many phone calls, so much paperwork. After paying her mom’s bills and taxes, selling off her house and possessions, and handling lawyers’ fees — setting aside for just a second the small piece of land that makes her an agricultural scion — it came to just under $50,000.
Something else Megan says she inherited from her mom, who worked for years in medical billing, was “not really a great sense of money management.”
So Megan used that money to pay off her own formidable credit card bills. She’d been in “a decent amount of debt” since 2008, and for the first time, she says, she was out from under Visa and even able to add to her savings. Today, she’s at something like breaking even; she’s found a balance between her outstanding graduate school debt, her expenses, her income, and the money she receives from the USDA to let her family land lie fallow.
Megan is grateful, and amazed that her mother was able to leave anything after a life of financial struggle. Ultimately, though, we’re talking about $50,000 in 2020s America, set against a person whom she loved deeply.
“I’d obviously much rather have my mom,” she says.
I nheritance
Inheritance
is a tricky thing to talk about, a subject that wraps up money, family, and death in one impossible package. For those who receive it, or stand to, it’s wealth that comes at a terrible moment; a boon and bureaucratic puzzle; and a reminder of someone you lost. For those who won’t be seeing any family money — which is to say, most people, but more on that later — it can feel deeply unfair. Millions of people lose loved ones and suffer greatly and only find their lives, and paying off their own debts, that much more difficult.
But inheritance is a conversation we need to have, because a great wealth transfer is upon us, coming soonish. A large amount of cash is expected to move from the pockets of boomers to everyone younger, though guesses at just how much and when vary: Forbes reports $30 trillion over “many years,” PNC says $59 trillion by 2061, CNBC mentions $68 trillion and 25 years, and the New York Times confirms the variety of these assessments but puts it at around $15 trillion over the next decade.
Wealth transfers, as an economic force, are more than just the money a person receives when someone dies — they also include tuition payments from a loved one, or loans for a house, or large monetary gifts from one living person to another. But a big, generational transfer is on the horizon, and while part of it is precipitated by possible changes to the generous inheritance laws the Trump administration put in place, as the baby boomers tick up in age, part of it is just the cycle of life.
Who’s getting this money, how are they getting it, and what’s it going to do? In “ Not All Millennials ,” published in the Drift, Kiara Barrows noted that “the distribution of this inheritance will fall along the lines of existing inequalities, deepening the fractures in any millennial program of economic solidarity.” And that’s certainly true — the nation’s top 1 percent have received more than 35 percent of the inherited wealth, according to Edward Wolff, a professor at New York University and the author of Inherited Wealth in America: Future Boom or Bust?
But Wolff also says, surprisingly, that inherited wealth isn’t a huge driver of inequality in America — it actually has had an equalizing effect. And there’s no indication that the next decades will be any different.
The reason is deceptively simple: While much (much!) more money flows among the rich, for middle- and low-income people who receive gifts or inheritance, they represent a larger percentage of wealth. So large, in fact, that for some people, a gift from mom or dad is the thing that will keep them middle class.
But recipients-wise, we’re not talking about a lot of people. Twenty-two percent of American households receive a wealth transfer, Wolff says in a phone interview — a significant figure but certainly not a majority.
When Wolff, who studies inequality, dives deeper into whom those inheritances go to and how, the picture looks a little different than you might expect. He says that for some middle- or low-income people, inherited assets can represent up to one-third of a person’s wealth. And Black families who do receive transfers, he says, actually rely more on those inheritances than white families do.
The majority of people who inherit aren’t getting millions, either; less than one-fifth of inheritances are more than $500,000. The most common inheritance is between $10,000 and $50,000.
None of this can quite explain the sum total of inherited wealth’s effect.
While it’s incontrovertible that anyone who receives an inheritance is plainly fortunate in at least one large respect — this isn’t a story about why you should feel bad for people who inherit — my conversations with those who have or expect to receive a sum from their families after death indicate that a transfer of wealth can be a lot of things: freeing and stifling, a relief and a burden, a windfall and a pitfall. It depends on one’s circumstances, which is really just to say that it depends on a person’s family, and their money.
For Megan, it meant months steeped in legalese, and freedom from (some of) her debt. For Dhruv, who expects to receive a large inheritance, the promise of future wealth has been a source of both privilege and internal conflict. Mindi, a returning student, found that her inheritance screwed up her financial aid and brought up complicated feelings about her relationship with her dad. Emily came into a sum she expected to spend on a parent’s medical care, and found her life changed. Jackie inherited her mother’s house 15 years ago but fears losing it to proposed changes to the tax code.

The wealth transfer, in increments of $20,000 or $30,000, has the potential to make a select few stable for the first time, to shore up some people on the shrinking island of the middle class. But these stories create a picture even more complex than a group of uncomfortably lucky mourners; they illustrate a country with byzantine and punishing legal and financial systems, mediocre financial education, and a culture of having and not having that doesn’t benefit very many people at all.

In
2018, Emily came into an amount of money she doesn’t hesitate to call “life-changing.”
When I reach her via video call to talk about inherited wealth, she has her meticulous personal budgets at the ready. She feels strongly about financial management, explaining that she gives all of her money a job — say, this $40 works for “hobbies” and that $100 goes to “pet care.” It’s a system that takes time and foresight and spreadsheets, but she’s passionate about financial education and the work it takes to be prepared for anything life throws at you.
Emily, 38, had been prepared for the eventuality of paying for the long-term care facility that her mother lived in once her mother’s money ran out. The facility cost $4,600 a month, which would have meant $2,300 each for Emily and her brother. It’s a price tag she calls “bananas,” but after her mother was diagnosed with early-onset Alzheimer’s, the siblings wanted care they could rely on.
When Emily was growing up, her family was poor. Her dad was not so good with money or employment, and her mom worked at an oil company, in the kind of job you get when you’re a woman with no college degree in the 1970s. The company did give her a pension, though, and after Emily’s mom got divorced and retired, she started to invest her money. With her kids’ help, she turned it into an impressive little nest egg, earmarked for her long-term care. It was enough to cover about three years at the facility. “We fully expected her to outlive the money,” Emily says.
Instead, in 2018, at 66, her mother fell and died six weeks later, leaving Emily and her brother $350,000 in assets. Emily and her husband had been living paycheck to carefully planned paycheck, and now, just like that, she has a financial safety net.
If her mother had lived to, say, 78, the average life span for an American woman, Emily would not have seen an inheritance. Instead, she’d likely be facing a sizable debt. Even for a planner, the change in fortune is hard to account for.
“It also feels incredibly guilty all the time,” she tells me.

The
first time I speak to Jackie, 54, she tells me about the seemingly tangled situation she is in with her mother’s home, which she inherited along with her siblings in 2006. The second time, I have good news to give her. At least, I hope I do.
Jackie has lived in the house in Los Angeles for years and needs to move on now, but two newish tax proposals seem to have her in a bind. One would make it expensive to rent out the home; the other might make it expensive to sell, unless she does so very fast. Jackie’s mother purchased the home back in the ’90s for $150,000, and it’s likely worth over $800,000 today. It should be a fortune, but after all these years, the house and the money have suddenly started to feel like a time bomb.
The bedrock of Jackie’s fears is a new California law that changes how inherited rental properties are assessed for tax. The concern that motivated this change was the subject of an LA Times piece that used Jeff and Beau Bridges to show how the elite had benefited from tax loopholes. Separately but simultaneously, President Joe Biden has a proposal that would change capital gains taxes.
Maybe you’re adept at tax law and already see the punchline here, but as Jackie explained her concerns to me over the phone, all I could do was take notes.
Then I brought Jackie’s story to a very kind tax professional, who agreed to speak with me on background, to see if we had a handle on her stressful position.
As it happens, we did not.
These laws don’t apply to Jackie for a very simple reason: Taxes are not applied retroactively.
I explained more, in greater detail than I will bother you with, but his answer was the same.
As the very kind tax professional told me, this is what happens when people are working with incomplete knowledge. Complete knowledge, it turns out, is incredibly important when you’re dealing with the tax code.
Meanwhile, incomplete knowledge is kind of the human condition. Tax professionals cost money, which can be prohibitive for many people, especially those who’ve received a windfall but worry they’re about to be staring down some enormous bills.

When
I was in high school, my dad and I used to fight about the estate tax, among other things. (I’d latched onto the topic at debate club, and one of our shared interests is arguing; my mom hates it.)
Like all arguments between fathers and daughters, this was actually a fight about everything: our worldviews, our expectations of each other, our ideas about what the future should look like.
I was (and remain) philosophically in favor of the tax, which might mean that I wouldn’t inherit every penny that he wanted to give me but also that perhaps the wealth gap wouldn’t yawn open further. (Spoiler: It did.) I saw my dad’s opposition as shortsighted and selfish; worse, selfish on my behalf. These loud conversations would usually end with him saying, “No one’s going to tell me what I can leave you!”
I’m an only child, and for as long as I can remember, my parents have been trying to impart to me that everything they have would someday be mine.
My dad’s favorite joke is that he’s spending money that’s somehow mine. The idea of a coming bequest is always present, whispered over my grandmother’s crystal glasses or intoned as we survey their recently renovated house from afar: “All of this is for you; this will be yours someday.”
According to a US News & World Report breakdown, my parents are upper middle class by earnings. They’re well-off and have always been upwardly mobile, out-earning my grandparents by a good margin. They’re tremendously hard-work-oriented and at one point owned multiple businesses together — including a popcorn store and a Hallmark store — while holding other jobs.
According to the same breakdown (and cross-checked with Pew’s Class Calculator ), I’m middle class. Which is to say that I’m downwardly mobile, despite a good job and a great and paid-off education. I’m massively ( massively ) fortunate, but the idea that I’ll ever, say, buy a home without my parents’ assistance seems impossible.
Fighting about the estate tax, one of my go-to talking points was, “We don’t even have that much money!” In 2003, a very big year for my dad and me yelling about this, the exemption was $1 million, meaning everything under that was free and clear, and the top rate over that was 49 percent .
I absolutely could not conceive that my parents might have a million dollars. I couldn’t, at the time, imagine what I would do with that much money (I didn’t have a great sense of value, and Zillow hadn’t been invented yet). My dad would talk about our house, which he built himself in the early ’80s, and I would zone out and then say, “Whatever, I’m not going to live in” the small, quaint town my parents had chosen for the excellent school system. Secretly, the thought of selling the home I grew up in broke my heart, and the idea of doing it because my parents were, in this scenario, dead made me feel sick.
They sold the house themselves last year. It went for $1,055,000. If my parents had died, instead of retiring and heading to Florida, and the tax still applied at that exemption level, I would have owed thousands. This likely would have forced my hand in exactly the way my dad feared.
It’s a moot point, though, because in 2021, the estate tax exemption isn’t a million bucks. It’s $11.7 million, and double that for couples, with anything over that amount taxed at as much as 40 percent. The exemption rose over the years that Trump was in office, starting at $5.49 million in 2017. I can confidently say my family is in the clear.
Still, even broadly very generous to those receiving a gift or inheritance, the estate tax is no more popular with voters now than it was with my dad two decades ago. According to a new poll of registered voters conducted for Vox by Data for Progress, only 40 percent of the 1,234 respondents support an estate tax.
Wolff chalks it up to a fairly human reaction: “People feel that they’re gonna win the lottery,” he says.
On some level, they’re aware that “they depend to a large extent on these bequests,” he says, “And they don’t want to see it gobbled up by taxes.” They don’t want to give up the safety net.

The
effect money has on life is a complex calculation.
Dhruv, 30, has not yet received an inheritance, but he knows it’s coming. His parents — his mom and stepdad, who raised him — are still alive, and he’s received financial gifts from them in various forms over the years, but the inheritance sort of looms.
He doesn’t know the specifics of their estate, but he says he has been told where and how to access it when the time comes. He estimates that it’s around $7 million, based on what he knows and from looking at their large, lovely house in Southern California, where he currently lives. He says the family doesn’t go more than a month without some reference to wealth being passed down, although often in slightly obscure ways, like when his mother mentions that this or that piece of jewelry would be nice for a granddaughter to have. (Neither Dhruv nor his brother has children yet.)
Dhruv’s family wasn’t always well off, not at all. When Dhruv was a baby, and his mom was still married to his biological father, they struggled. And when he was around 5 and she married his stepdad, a mechanic, they also struggled. It was a few years later that the couple launched a business that became a huge success.
His mom is “tough, because she had to be for a while,” and “intense” with money, Dhruv says. She’s worked to secure this inheritance for him and his brother, including handling the paperwork to ensure that they will receive property in India, where she grew up.
Her story isn’t all that unusual. The people most interested in allocating money for their kids, say some of the financial professionals I spoke with, are often those who come from a less affluent background.
Shala Walker, a certified financial planner with Stavis & Cohen in Houston, Texas, says in her experience, it’s higher-net-worth individuals who are less likely to want to leave assets to their kids. “I don’t know if it’s a realization of the opportunities that their kids have had, or even … the fact that they don’t necessarily need it.”
Sometimes, Dhruv says, his mom “tries to make all the financial decisions.” He has developed a very different personality; he describes himself as the “opposite of a micromanager.”
The money has affected him in other ways. When Dhruv was in college, he heard an economics professor say that job scarcity is a feature of most economies, and the fact that there isn’t enough work to go around is “unavoidable.” Currently unemployed but trained as a psychiatric researcher, he thinks of that when he looks at the job market. He wonders whether it’s okay for him to have a certain job when that job could go to someone who needs it more.
He’s worked a variety of jobs — at McDonald’s as a teen, as a teacher in Asia, in psychiatric hospitals and with nonprofits — but for his teenage and adult life, he’s always known that if he needed to, he could get a bailout. It’s allowed him to take risks, like moving to Asia with no employment, and to be secure in situations that would be devastating to other people. Out of work, he was still comfortable, living at home, with plenty in savings, eligible for unemployment.
“I always know I have a safety net of sorts — a lot of people do, but, like, I definitely have one,” he says.

Money
can mean security, no question. It can also represent something more like control.
Mindi grew up with a very wealthy father and not a lot of money. Her parents were divorced, and while she was raised in an apartment with two of her siblings and her mom, her dad had a big house, drove nice cars, and carried a lot of cash. “I don’t mean $100 or $200,” she says. “I mean, like, he had $5,000 in his pocket at all times.”
He used that money as a carrot, dangling 50 percent of the cost of whatever she wanted, insisting she or her mother pay the rest. He refused to help her pay for design school when she was young. But he promised, often, that she would be taken care of when he died.
So when he did, in 2018, when Mindi was 46, she was surprised at the size of her inheritance. It came to around $112,000 each for her and her four siblings. From her father’s big talk, from his big job with Hughes Aircraft (Hughes as in Howard), from his big wad of cash, Mindi had expected something very different.
The settling of the will, she says, was difficult and prolonged, with recriminations between siblings and half-siblings, their stepmother, stepsiblings, estate lawyers, seemingly everyone around. The actual total value of the estate remains unclear to her, and she says that many of the relationships will never recover.
But when the money came in, she purchased a Chanel bag, and then a vacation with her fiancé and kids. She bought a car with cash, and paid off every bill she had, except for student loans. At the time, she was a returning student, finally studying design. Then she was hit with a curveball: Her windfall “completely screwed up” her financial aid. And then Covid-19 happened, putting her fiancé out of work. Mindi says the money “evaporated.” In the end, she couldn’t even pay the taxes on it.
Before he died, Mindi’s father was in the habit of changing his will, or at least telling his kids that he had, after a fight with this or that child. Mindi was out, or her sister was. He’d put cars in their names and take them off again. She never knew quite where she stood.
Today, Mindi says she’s grateful for what she received, happy to be remembered. She wishes, though, that her dad would have spent more time with her when he was alive; that their relationship had been better. She hopes her kids never fight about money.

If
you’re going to talk substantively about the impact of inherited wealth, you can’t focus only on the impact on one-fifth of people. The fact of inheritance reverberates among the other 80 percent, often in big ways.
Among that group is Ivie, a multimedia journalist based in New York, who says that all she ever wanted was to be comfortable.
Last month, Cherrell Brown, a community organizer and educator who tweets under the handle @awkward_duck, tweeted , “S/o to the folks with no security net. Who won’t inherit any wealth or property from any family. Those who are their parent(s) only retirement plan. The grind, the pressure, the stakes are different.”
The hundreds of replies illuminate what it means to live without financial underpinnings. Mostly young people of color, they had taken in a family member’s kids, were caring for their own parents, or were otherwise navigating a world where others don’t share their economic stresses.
Ivie is one of the many people who responded to Brown’s post, writing that the lack of generational wealth is what keeps her motivated. Ivie tells me later that she’s never really had a choice about how hard she works, because she knew she didn’t have a safety net.
Ivie’s family emigrated from Nigeria, and she grew up in the Bronx. She went to NYU, known for its wealthy student body and high cost . While other students (like me) took internships, Ivie worked a series of jobs, running around the city collecting textbooks, telemarketing, working at Forever 21. Her classmates could call home for money if they needed; she didn’t have that option.
“Even when you are thriving,” she says, you’re still “a million steps behind” someone who has any kind of generational wealth or even structure. Even with no foreseeable inheritance, inheritance looms over her life.
She doesn’t want the big money; she just wants to be comfortable. The greatest thing money can provide seems to be steadiness, and freedom from fear.
“I think the biggest inheritance that I have received has been being born in America,” she says. “If I’m being honest, that’s an advantage. And I just had to take that and run with it.”
Like these other inheritances, it’s a tangled one.

It’s
an indictment of the US that one of the best ways for a middle-class American to hold onto that status is to have someone who loves them a lot die.
I called my dad recently to ask how much money he made before he retired two years ago, seized with a realization that, like Dhruv and just about everyone else in this story, I’d never had a clear understanding of my own safety net. It was a weird call: I stammered, he explained his finances readily. They still felt like none of my business.
Before I could hang up, he stopped me, “It’s really about family, though,” he says, meaning this story.
He’s right, although maybe not exactly in the way that he means. He’s thinking of family as a symbol of self-sacrifice, a promise from parent to child. But it’s family, and so it’s complicated; we affect each other in great and lamentable ways.
There are parents who leave their children something not out of a deep want, but out of obligation, or tradition, or ideas about legacy, or lack of a better option. There are low-income parents who would love to be able to give their children something but can’t, and there are wealthy parents who could give their children a lot but choose not to — out of a desire to see them succeed on their own, or out of a deep lack of generosity, or out of 47,000 other reasons I can’t even conceive of. Whatever the reason, it is deeply personal.
If the fundamental problem, though, is that some people have security and others don’t, there might be some hope. It is possible to build a bigger safety net without spooking people that you’re going to tear a hole in theirs. It’s possible to create a system that doesn’t depend on coming from a stable, fortunate, generous family.
Wolff is in favor of policies that might combat inequality. He sees solutions in boosting incomes, which will in turn boost the savings rate, a major concern; and aiding unions, which will push for keeping wages high. He also likes Biden’s child tax credit , which offers a $3,000 yearly allowance to parents, and the plan to raise the minimum wage , which he says will likely have an “escalator effect” (like trickle-down economics, but the opposite, and real). He’s enthusiastic about baby bonds , which would guarantee everyone $1,000 in a tax-free savings account. And there’s always the various proposals to levy a wealth tax ; he’s even written one of his own.
Ultimately, inheritance — money of any kind, really — is most vital in its role as a solid foundation. Everyone deserves that. We’d be better off if America wanted it for Americans as much as some Americans want it for their own kids.
For now, we’re stuck with this piecemeal system, one that works only for some people, and only sometimes. Intermingled as it is with complication and grief, there are small moments of grace.
During Megan’s mom’s life, she and Megan were both plagued by debt. Now, alone, Megan has a solid foundation. “I think she knew that when she died, my life, with whatever I inherited, would be a little bit better off,” Megan tells me.
It is, and it isn’t. Death is inevitable, though; security is a rare and precious gift.

Can you actually eat raw mushrooms ? Are they safe ? If yes, what mushrooms can you eat ?
This is what we’re aiming to answer today, and hopefully get a really good understanding of just why folks are averse to eating raw mushrooms in the first place.
First, let’s talk about what a mushroom is made of, so we know what we’re dealing with here. Everyone knows what a mushroom is or what it looks like, but nutritional makeup is another story.
Table Of Content show
We’re going to talk about the white mushroom for this part, since it’s probably the most common type you’ll find on shelves and in your home.
If you’re not sure what those are, white mushrooms are champignons, button, table or small Portobello mushrooms.
You can also find their very close cousins, the brown capped mushrooms, with pretty much the same nutritional makeup and they’re stocked right next to each other.
And alongside them you’ll find oyster mushrooms, the very large, wide ones and those are pretty mush the best (in terms of texture) for meat substitutes.
But right now let’s talk white mushrooms. The USFDA ( source ) says that 100 grams of white, raw mushrooms are made up of:
- 92.45 gr water (like most vegetables)
- 3.09 grams protein
- 1 gr of dietary fiber
- 3.26 gr of carbs
- 0.34 grams of fat
There’s really not much there that’s going to hurt or sit badly with you if you eat them raw.
And if you’ve ever cooked mushrooms you know they give a whole lot of water and really shrink when cooked.
What most folks worry about though is agaritine. If you don’t know what that is, it’s basically a naturally occurring compound that has been noticed to promote cancer in mice studies, mostly by messing with the DNA structure.
Now, one thing to note about agaritine and the mice studies is that another set of mice were fed agaritine-spiked water for their entire lives and were fine. So that’s a bit confusing.
Another fact is that agaritine is present in freshly picked mushrooms, but its levels go down significantly when it’s been subjected to any cooking or storing.
Meaning high heat AND refrigeration will make it go down, as will simply storing the mushrooms.
As long as your mushrooms are store-bought, they’ve been refrigerated and stored for a couple of days before they got in your own fridge.
That being said, if you’re growing your own mushrooms and you’re literally just picked them, then yes they may just have more fo that compound.
Let’s talk about eating them for a second because this is what’s got everyone in a twist.
Circling back to texture, we should really ask ourselves if we even want to eat raw mushrooms.
If you’ve only had cooked mushrooms then you know their soft texture. But if you eat them raw they won’t be as soft and their flavor is going to be very different.
Much more earthy and stronger in general, and that’s not for everyone. If you’re a fan of mushrooms in general then you’d probably love them raw, but if you’re the type who likes to drown mushrooms in garlic then you probably won’t enjoy them as much.
For the most part any edible mushroom can be eaten raw, at least in theory.
There are tougher mushrooms like the oyster mushrooms that really need some cooking to soften up, as do boletus-type mushrooms (like the Penny Bun or Porcini).
The white button mushrooms, as well as their brown capped cousins are alright to eat as-is, as long as you wash them very thoroughly and check between their gills.
However these two belong to the genus Agaricus, and have the highest amounts of agaritine. If you’re worried about that part, maybe skip these. If you want to give them a try, go ahead.
Reishi mushrooms are tough and you actually need to cook them through if you want to eat them.
In short most of the edible mushrooms you can find can also be eaten raw, but we suggest really thinking about the difference in texture since it’s a big change from cooked mushrooms, and worth noting.
From a certain standpoint mushrooms seems to be healthier if cooked.
This is mostly due to their tough cell walls, which are pretty much keeping the nutrients locked in. Heat breaks down those walls and helps the body absorb them better.
That being said, you will get a certain amount of nutritional value from raw mushrooms, just not as much as if they were cooked.
We should also take a step back here and take a look at our plate. If we’re after nutrition then 3 medium sized Portobellos once a week will not affect our diet.
Nutrition and diets are very complex and you need commitment for them to work.
Much like with health benefits derived from green tea or health supplements, being inconsistent with them will not get any results.
To be absolutely safe and sound, you may indeed need to cook mushrooms. Any bacteria, viruses or spores present on them will die off if they’re kept at high heat for several minutes so it’s best to cook them from a food safety standpoint.
All that being said, it’s completely up to you to decide if you want to eat your mushrooms raw.
Keep in mind that there’s a difference both in texture and in flavor. It might be a good thing, it might be a bad thing, it really varies from person to person.
As for agaritine, you should take a look at how often you eat mushrooms, how much of them you eat, and what type. If your general intake is low then you’re probably fine with them raw as well.

It can help identify different types of diseases and provide radiologists with help in prioritizing life-threatening cases. However, it is important to note that AI is not perfect and can still make errors.",Artificial intelligence (AI) can be used to improve medical diagnoses.,"Artificial intelligence (AI) has become synonymous with support and efficiency in the medical community. From a technology viewed with suspicion as claims touted it the replacement for the medical professional, AI has evolved to become the second pair of eyes that never need to sleep. Artificial intelligence in medical diagnosis and healthcare provides overworked medical practitioners and facilities with reliable support, helping to minimize workload pressure while maximizing practitioner efficiency.
Artificial intelligence in medical diagnosis helps with medical decision making, management, automation, admin, and workflows. It can be used to diagnose cancer, triage critical findings in medical imaging, flag acute abnormalities, provide radiologists with help in prioritizing life threatening cases, diagnose cardiac arrhythmias, predict stroke outcomes , and help with the management of chronic diseases. AI is a rich realm of data, algorithms, analytics, deep learning, neural networks and insights that’s constantly growing and adapting to the needs of the healthcare industry and its patients. Over the past few years, artificial intelligence in medical diagnosis has shown immense promise in changing the standards of medical care while reducing the extreme pressures felt by the medical industry.
Physician burnout is a very real problem . The exhaustion and overwork felt by many medical professionals is impacting on their performance. Physicians are leaving their jobs, struggling to deliver quality patient care, and juggling complex emotional challenges. This is largely brought on by long hours, overwhelming workloads and a lack of support. Physicians make complex and life changing decisions, daily, and often are not given either the space or time to manage their workloads effectively. In the recent Medscape National Physician Burnout and Suicide Report 2022 , the statistics pointed to the risks inherent in putting too much pressure on practitioners, especially those trying to juggle families, retirement planning and the complexities of their jobs.
In this year’s report, 47% of physicians revealed that they’re burned out. The specialties most affected being emergency medicine, critical care, family medicine, neurology, urology, and internal medicine. The leading cause? The administrative burden.
This is where AI can play a pivotal role. Designed with intent, artificial intelligence in medical diagnosis can not only reduce the pressure on physicians when working through vast quantities of information and imaging, but it can be used to undertake a large percentage of the administrative burden. The right solutions, developed specifically for the healthcare sector, can be used to provide medical practitioners with essential support as they manage increasing volumes of data, information and imaging volumes.
AI can provide tangible support to overworked physicians with systems that are designed to minimize stress and increase time spent with patients.
Artificial intelligence in medical diagnosis is a powerful tool for reducing physician burnout, but equally for providing the radiology professional with exceptional support in managing workloads that are only on the increase. Radiologists have to deal with multiple and rising imaging volumes, and they’re expected to do so at speeds that were previously unheard of. Today, they have to sift through volumes of images while still prioritizing those that are urgent and managing patient care.
This is where artificial intelligence in medical diagnosis really shines. AI and deep learning solutions have been providing radiologists with essential support as they manage these weighty imaging volumes, offering them the ability to streamline workflows, save time, increase capacity and increase diagnosis reliability. This reduces pressure on the radiologist significantly. Solutions such as Aidoc go through the vast quantities of images, flagging those that the AI consider to be of concern. The radiologist can then assess the flagged images as a matter of priority, thereby catching urgent cases faster without compromising on their existing workloads or cases.
Aidoc has obtained 13 FDA/CE clearances for the flagging and prioritization of acute abnormalities in CT scans and is already deployed and showing value at over 1000 medical facilities across the world.
Artificial intelligence in medical diagnosis is still on the edge of its potential. There’s plenty of room for growth and for the technology to improve on what it can do to support the medical profession.

How many liters of air can a lungs hold?
At maximal capacity, an average lung can hold almost six liters of air, but lungs do not usually operate at maximal capacity. Air in the lungs is measured in terms of lung volumes and lung capacities (see Figure 1 and Table 1). Volume measures the amount of air for one function (such as inhalation or exhalation).
What happens when we breathe more deeply?
This mirrors what happens when a bigger volume of air is displaced when we breathe more deeply. This dynamic works because of air pressure, a measure of how hard air presses against objects.

So the privacy injunction isn't dead. But does the law look the ass the Daily Mail branded it last month?
My answer has to be yes after the supreme court sensationally overruled the appeal court in the case of the celebrity , known only as 'PJS', involved in an extra-marital 'threesome'.
So now those of you who – in England and Wales only, remember – still don't know the name must remain in the dark.
That adds up to no more than half the population of the two countries at most, by my reckoning.
The other day I conducted a little experiment by asking 20 non-media friends if they knew who PJS was. Without any prompting 12 did and, supreme court please note before you order my arrest, I didn't enlighten the remaining eight, to their annoyance.
Those who did know were fully aware via social media, tapping into foreign media websites or simply joining the chat around the office water cooler or down at the Dog and Duck.
The supreme court's surprise overruling of the appeal court's provisional decision last month to lift the gag came in a 4-1 majority decision. My verdict is the one got it right and the four got it badly wrong.
The result also came as a shock to most leading media lawyers I know and, I suspect, to PJSs' own highly expensive legal team, led by Desmond Browne QC who, incidentally, spends at least as much time defending newspapers as he does seeking to gag them.
The result also doubtless brought heavy sighs of relief from the 20 other celebrities and VIPs currently holding privacy injunctions against mainstream UK newspapers and who were mortified at the anticipated lifting of the gag around PJS and their spouse by the supreme court.
Delivering the supreme court's majority decision, Lord Mance ruled that the appeal court got ""very wrong"" the ""balance between freedom of expression and the right to privacy"". He went on: ""Second there is no public interest (however much it may be of interst to some members of the public) in publishing kiss and tell stories or criticisms of private sexual conduct simply because the person is well-known and there is no right to invade their privacy by publishing them.""
It was, for my money, a sweeping generalisation that lawyers for the Sun on Sunday who had fought long and hard for the right to publish the 'PJS' story will be studying closely and exploring the possibility of challenging again.
In its fight to publish, the Sun had been loudly backed by most of its rivals, most vociferously the Mail and the Telegraph. OK, there were commercial motives as much as press freedom and freedom of expression involved, but that doesn't devalue the legitimate arguments in favour of publishing.
The Sun on Sunday had argued that the star and well-known spouse had promoted an image of idyllic marriage and parenthood which gave the public a misleading impression of fidelity and thus amounted to hypocrisy.
But where I think the appeal court got it right and the supreme court got it wrong lies as much in the brutal reality of modern communications as moral judgements about celebrities' sexual shenanigans.
The stark reality is that the injunction at the centre of this case applies only to England and Wales and not even to Scotland where PJS has been identified . And certainly not to the US and many other nations where identities have been published in mainstream publications, broadcast on the airwaves and discussed across the largely frontier-free zone of social media cyberspace.
In the earlier but now overturned appeal court written judgement, a trio of senior judges accepted that maintaining a gagging order in England and Wales only after it had been published beyond their jurisdiction across both social and mainstream media was a 'hopeless task'.
They wrote: ""This court has little control over what foreign newspapers and magazines may publish. Those who are interested already have no difficulty finding out who the secret celebrities are. Websites discussing the story will continue to pop up. As one is taken down, another will appear.""
In another marked contrast to the supreme court, appeal court judge Lord Justice Jackson suggested the celebrity couple's children ""cannot be a trump card"" and added: ""In my view, whether or not the court grants an injunction, it is inevitable that the children will in due course learn about these matters.""
I'd call the appeal court the modern communications world realists this time and the supreme court the reverse, preserving the unpreservable.
Several times during the lengthy legal scrap, broadcasters have asked whether PJS was like King Canute trying to turn back the tide. To which I've replied: ""No, Canute was only trying to hold back the sea, this person's trying to hold back the tsunami of global cyberspace.""
Well, for the moment I'm wrong – in England and Wales, anyway – but not for long I suspect as editors in the US and elsewhere threaten to expose more and more VIP UK beneficiaries of privacy injunctions.
It's clear that the Murdoch-owned Sun on Sunday won't back down (rightly so, in my view) and will take the case to a full trial later this year.
For me the most telling comment out of the supreme court came from the lone dissenting judge Lord Toulson, a privacy expert, who echoed much of the appeal court's pragmatism, pointedly remarking: ""The court must live in the world as it is and not in the world it might like it to be."" He also pointed out the practical problems of hiding the story from the couple's children and suggested that identifying who PJS really is now wouldn't impact on their right to sue the Sun on Sunday for damages for invading their privacy in a post-publication civil case.
It was a sharp contrast to Lord Justice Mance's ruling that – despite the acknowledged widespread publication outside England and Wales in the mainstream media as well as on social media – ""if the injunction were to be lifted there would be intensive coverage in the Sun on Sunday, and very likely other papers, as well as unrestricted internet and social media coverage"".
Rather lost in all of this, however, was the fact that there were other people involved in that extra-marital boudoir encounter and they want to kiss and tell/sell their story to the Sun on Sunday. What about their 'right' of free speech? Are privacy injunctions all too often the preserve of the rich, famous and powerful at the expense of lesser mortals? (The PJS case is already estimated to have cost well over £1m in legal bills). Often, too, these are famous folk only too ready to invade their own privacy when it suits their PR/promotional interests. Still it's all a nice little earner for the legal eagles, if no one else!
A source close to 'PJS' told me later that they were ""delighted by the supreme court's wise decision to overturn a flawed appeal court decision"". They went on: ""Ideally he'd like the Sun on Sunday to abandon any idea of going to full trial, but he fully expects they'll fight on. This is a matter of strong principle for him, not just for himself but for others too facing unreasonable media intrusion. So he'll continue the fight, regardless of the financial costs involved.""
Despite today's supreme court judgement, I'd still diagnose the celebrity privacy injunction to be in the critical ward on life support machinery with men and women in wigs rather than wearing white coats and stethoscopes supervising as the last rites loom.
And even if you don't care or know who PJS is, remember that media-gagging injunctions can also be the weapon of last resort for dodgy businessmen, corrupt corporates and politicos with secrets to hide from you.

This is because bacteria grow rapidly between 40°F and 140°F, so cooling food quickly can help keep it safe to eat. From a material science perspective, cooling hot food before refrigerating or freezing it may also help prevent thermal shock that could damage the container or other materials in the fridge/freezer.","When hot food is placed in the refrigerator or freezer, it can raise the temperature inside and put other food at risk of bacterial growth.","The way you cool and store these large amounts of food can make all the difference between keeping food safe or the growth of pathogens that can make food unsafe for eating which could lead to foodborne illnesses.
Cooking up a large pot of your favorite soup, stew or chili is a great way to plan ahead for quick meals at home. The way you cool and store these large amounts of food can make all the difference between keeping food safe or the growth of pathogens that can make food unsafe for eating which could lead to foodborne illnesses.
The United States Department of Agriculture and Michigan State University Extension recommend the following methods of cooling and storage to keep food safe. The two-stage cooling method has been used in commercial food service and is a method that can be utilized at home.
- A large pot of food like soup, chili or stew should be divided into small portions and put in shallow containers before being refrigerated.
- A large cut of meat or whole poultry should be divided into smaller pieces and wrapped separately or placed in shallow containers before refrigerating. Shallow containers or small amounts of hot food can be placed directly in the refrigerator.
- Clean the sink in the kitchen and fill it with clean cold water and ice. Then place the pot of food or smaller containers in the ice water. Be careful not to let water in the sink mix with food in the pot. If you stir the contents of the pot in the ice water it will help to cool it more quickly.
- To use the two-stage cooling method, food must be cooled from 140 to 70 degrees Fahrenheit within two hours and to 41 F or lower within four hours. Using the cooling method ensures that food is cooled quickly and safely. Use a food thermometer to measure the temperature during the cooling period.
- A large pot or container of food that is hot should not be placed in the refrigerator or freezer. The hot food can raise the temperature inside the refrigerator/freezer which can be a risk for food already in the appliance.
- Do not cool food outdoors- the temperatures fluctuate and animals may try to get into the food exposing it to pathogens and bacteria.
- Use a food thermometer to verify temperatures. Never leave food in the “Danger Zone” over 2 hours. The “ Danger Zone ” is the temperature range between 40 and 140 F in which bacteria can grow rapidly. To keep food out of the Danger Zone, keep cold food cold, at or below 40 F, and hot food hot, at or above 140 F.
Following these simple steps will ensure that your food remains safe to eat for you and your family. So when you come home from work or other events the soup you are looking forward to eating will be safe and not cause a foodborne illness.

By Eman M. Elshaikh
During the Cold War, Middle Eastern leaders sought to cast off the burden of old European colonialism. But they had to account for a Cold War between two new imperial superpowers.
What are the first words that come to mind when you hear the term ""the Middle East""? Your answer probably depends on where you live. For a lot of Americans, ""conflict,"" ""oil,"" and ""Islam"" might come to mind. Many Americans think that Middle Eastern conflicts are inevitable and based on ancient religious disputes. But this is a misconception. The idea that conflict is inherent to the Middle East might be rooted in the fact that the United States has fought a series of seemingly unending wars in the region for the last two decades. Those wars, like earlier conflicts in the twentieth century, have a lot to do with oil. But they also have a lot to do with colonialism. What does colonialism have to do with the Middle East? The term ""the Middle East"" is itself a British colonial invention. It takes a European point of view, geographically speaking. Along with the ""Near"" and ""Far East,"" British imperialists coined the term in the nineteenth century. During the Second World War, the American military adopted and popularized the term. But no one can seem to agree on where the Middle East is. Some argue it includes everything between Egypt and India. Others say that North Africa and Central Asia are included. No matter where you draw its borders, it's a contested term. Speaking of drawing lines, let's take a look at World War I, European colonialism, and how the modern Middle East came to be.
By 1914, the Ottoman Sultans ruled a crumbling empire. For 600 years, the Ottoman Empire dominated much of what we now call the Middle East. Their influence shaped the cultural, political, and religious character of a vast region from Morocco to Iraq and from Egypt to Eastern Europe. But beginning in the nineteenth century, the empire began to decline, and many of its territories fell to European control. During the First World War, the Ottomans sided with the Central Powers against Britain and France. In 1916, British and French diplomats signed a secret treaty called the Sykes-Picot Agreement, which divided Ottoman territories into European spheres of influence. Basically, British and French diplomats got together in a room and drew lines on a map to determine which of them would control what Ottoman territories. At the same time, other British diplomats were meeting with Britain's Arab allies and promising them the same territories, but they didn't keep this promise. After World War I, British and French imperialists divided the Ottoman territories between them. The communities living in many of these territories would not gain independence until after World War II. The lines drawn by secret treaties like the Sykes-Picot agreement helped set the borders of many modern Middle Eastern nation-states. But the borders drawn by Europeans reflected European priorities. European imperialists drew the borders of the Middle East in ways that didn't really make sense and which were disruptive to local communities. Some ethnic groups, like the Kurds, watched as their territory and populations were divided between several different nation-states. Some, like the Palestinians, didn't get a nation-state at all. Direct European control faded in the 1950s, but informal colonialism continued to shape regional politics. Soon, American and Soviet influence arrived as both superpowers sought to gain allies in their Cold War struggle against each other. Let's explore the connections between decolonization and the Cold War by looking at the two most populous Middle Eastern nations: Egypt and Iran.

In the late nineteenth century, a new canal in Egypt reshaped global networks. Before 1869, if Europeans wanted to sail to the Indian Ocean, they had to travel about 12,000 miles around Africa. The Suez Canal cut that trip in half. This thin strip of water, and the events that surrounded it, captures a wide array of trends in the modern Middle East. Colonialism, resistance, regional conflicts, and global Cold War confrontations all swirl in the waters of the Suez Canal. The Suez Canal is in Egypt, but it was built by a private company—jointly owned by French investors and Egyptian leaders. When Egypt ran into money problems, the government sold off its shares to the British government. In effect, this meant that a British and French company now owned an incredibly important and profitable canal that cut 120 miles through Egypt. Control of the canal eventually led to a British occupation of Egypt and decades of colonial control. Even after Egypt gained independence in 1922, the Suez Canal Company continued to own and profit from the canal. Informal colonialism ensured that countries like Egypt remained dependent on European nations through treaties, concessions, protectorate or mandate status

, or economic influence. In 1956, the Suez Crisis collided spectacularly with the Cold War as one Egyptian leader sought to end Egypt's dependence on Europeans. In 1956, a charismatic Egyptian leader named Gamal Abdel Nasser seized control of the canal and nationalized it—placing the canal and its profits under Egyptian control. In response, Britain, France and Israel invaded. The crisis escalated until the United States and the Soviet Union intervened. In a display of how much global power had shifted away from European empires, pressure from the two superpowers forced Britain and France to back down. When President Nasser nationalized the Suez Canal, the Egyptian people—and Arab people in many nations—celebrated him as an anti-colonial hero. They gave him credit for defeating the British, French, and Israeli armies. But American and Soviet intervention had been the deciding factor. The face of global power had shifted dramatically. Leaders like Nasser now had to navigate new relationships with the superpowers.

One of the reasons the Suez Canal was so important was its ability to quickly move Middle Eastern oil from the Persian Gulf to European and American markets. European imperialists worked hard to control the Suez Canal, but they also sought direct control over oil in countries like Iran. Thanks to a concession signed 50 years earlier, by 1951, Iran's vast oil wealth was controlled by the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company, which despite its name, was a British company

. British control of the nation's most valuable resource became increasingly unpopular with the Iranian people. In 1951, three days after becoming Iran's prime minister, Mohammad Mossadegh nationalized control of Iran's oil, seizing production and profits from the British company and placing it in the hands of the Iranian government. The Iranian people celebrated this move, but the American government did not, siding instead with the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company. The US decision was partly based on the misperception that Mossadegh was a communist. Without American support, Mossadegh failed where Nasser had succeeded. The American navy set up a blockade, preventing Iran from selling its oil. Unintimidated, Mossadegh refused to back down—so the United States organized a covert, CIA-planned coup. Despite Mossadegh's popularity, the coup removed him from power and reinstalled the unpopular shah (monarch), Mohammad Reza Pahlavi. While in power, the shah aligned himself with the United States and ran his country as a repressive dictatorship. In 1979, a revolution overthrew the shah and established a revolutionary government, which was suspicious of foreign involvement—especially American involvement.
Nasser's nationalization of the Suez Canal worked out in Egypt's favor, but Mossadegh's nationalization of Iran's oil was undermined by foreign interference. Despite their different outcomes, both cases illustrate how the Cold War and decolonization shifted global and regional power. Many Middle Eastern nations fought against formal and informal colonialism. Leaders in decolonizing nations had to be strategic in order to survive. And they had to account for new kinds of imperialism, which no longer had a European face. The United States and Soviet Union competed against each other to gain allies and influence in the Middle East. But to people in the region, the Americans and Soviets were simply new faces on the old imperialism. So, the next time someone tells you ""the Middle East is a violent place"" or that ""problems in the Middle East are the result of ancient religious conflicts,"" you should remind them that many of the worst conflicts in the region are direct results of twentieth-century colonialism and Cold War politics. Remind them of how quick imperial powers have been to incite violence whenever their access to Middle Eastern oil was threatened. How might this quite recent history factor into policy decisions today?

8:10 p.m. — Kiya, Megan and Trenton have little time to celebrate their Top 3 status when Gordon calls them all back to the dining room shortly after they crack open a bottle of wine. Just 30 minutes before midnight, Gordon has another challenge up his sleeve before the grand finale. Each chef will have to design a stunning menu featuring one cold appetizer, one hot appetizer and three entrees including one seafood, one red meat and one surf-n-turf dish. They will be helped out by sous chefs Christina Wilson (assisting Megan), Jason Santos (assisting Kiya) and Michelle Tribble (assisting Trenton). Kiya is nervous because she’s never created her own menu. She asks if she can use deer meat, but Jason thinks that will limit her. He helps pull her in a different direction with some delicious seafood options. Megan’s menu seems to come naturally with a mix of femininity and Texas staples. Trenton leans on his Arkansas roots and fruity salads.
8:20 p.m. — After a long night of menu planning and very little sleep, the chefs wake up for one-on-one menu meetings at Nobu with Gordon. He surprises each of them with visitors from home including Megan’s parents, Kiya’s mom and sister and Trenton’s girlfriend and father. The all get some time to connect before the competition continues.
8:30 p.m. — Gordon gets the three remaining chefs gussied up with their own stylist, hair and makeup person. Next they take a limo to a helicopter and fly over the Vegas strip to their final challenge. In front of their family, friends, former competitors and fans, the competitors will have to cook five amazing dishes. The top two finishers will lead their kitchens in tomorrow night’s final dinner service. One will become the Season 20 winner. The final challenge starts now!
8:45 p.m. — The Top 3 are cooking up their menu alongside their sous chefs in hopes of winning over Gordon. They put their hearts and souls on a plate and it’s time for their final judgment. Each of the five dishes will be judged by five guest judges and rated on a scale of 1-10. Ming Tsai rates the cold appetizers first giving Kiya’s bruschetta salad a 10, Trenton’s watermelon salad a 10 and Megan’s berry salad a 9. Next Jennifer Jasinski rates the hot appetizers giving Trenton’s pea risotto a 9, Megan’s pan-seared scallops an 8 and Kiya’s Asian chicken lollipops a 9. Judging the seafood entrée is Aaron Sanchez and he rates Megan’s salmon a 9, Kiya’s salmon an 8 and Trenton’s trout a 10.
8:55 p.m. — With just two dishes left, this race to the final dining service is tight! Trenton is leading with 29 with Kiya in second place at 27 and Megan right behind with 26 points. Roy Yamaguchi judges the red meat entrées and gives Trenton’s steak a 10, Megan’s ribeye an 8 and Kiya’s steak an 8. The final surf-n-turf dish is judged by Aaron Franklin and he gives Kiya’s filet & crab cake an 8, Trenton’s steak & shrimp a 9 and Megan’s filet & shrimp a 10. Trenton sails into the finale with a total score of 48. Megan squeaks through in second place with 44 points. Kiya will say goodbye in third place, missing the final dinner service by one point with a score of 43.
9:00 p.m. — Trenton and Megan will now have to choose their teams for the final dinner service from the eliminated chefs who have gone before them. Since Trenton received the highest score in the final challenge, he will choose first. Trenton’s team will include Kiya, Antonio Ruiz , Brynn Gibson and Sam Garman . Megan’s team will consist of Steve Glenn , Victoria Sonora , Emily Hersh and Josie Clemens . It’s interesting that Trenton chose Kiya as his first pick considering how much she hates him. Meanwhile, Josie calls Megan’s team a band of misfits, so this should be an interesting final dinner service!
9:10 p.m. — Prior to dinner service, Trenton wants to put his past conflicts with Kiya and Brynn behind him. Kiya says Trenton is not a good team leader and she and Brynn hate him. Emily thinks Megan is a humble leader and says she’s afraid of sounding “bossy.” As the chefs head into the kitchen, Trenton tells his team to “shut the f*** up” and “get on the same page.” Megan starts by asking everyone if they’re okay. Which style of leadership will prevail? Kiya feels disrespected by Trenton and it makes her unmotivated to do her best. Megan is on the opposite side of the spectrum, almost fearful of delivering the slightest criticism to her teammates.
9:20 p.m. — Megan’s sous chef Christina pulls her aside and tells her to quit asking the team to complete tasks. She needs to take control and be more demanding if she wants to win. Gordon gives Megan’s and Trenton’s final dishes one more lookover and offers some advice. He says Josie is overcooking Megan’s chicken and the vegan needs to be put in check. Trenton’s entrée is too small and he needs more seasoning on his chicken. Later Gordon pulls Megan and Trenton both into the dorms and confronts them with a bag of marijuana that was found. He threatens to disqualify whoever is responsible and demands the truth. Megan and Trenton both look mortified.
9:30 p.m. — Gordon has security guards open up the bags of “joints” and reveals they are actually head chef jackets for Megan and Trenton. It was all a prank to scare the finalists before their dinner service. Gordon has a fun laugh while Megan nearly begins to cry. Next he gives each of them a pep talk and tells them he’s proud of them and he wants them to own every ticket. The finalists must take charge and be the boss tonight. Then he opens up a brief case with $250,000 of cash in it. That is what’s at stake. After introducing themselves to the diners, Megan and Trenton head into the kitchen and begin the final dinner service.
9:40 p.m. — Trenton’s kitchen hits a snag with Antonio’s undercooked risotto. Trenton provides some coaching and Antonio recovers nicely. Megan seems to have tightened up her leadership skills and is no longer playing nice. Victoria gives her a bit of a nuisance by working too slowly on crab cakes. Regardless, things taste great and Megan is moving her appetizers out to diners. Trenton has also taken charge of his brigade and both kitchens are firing their first entrees of the night. Kiya pledges to give it her all at the meat station despite her disdain for Trenton. Brynn serves up garnish two minutes early and Kiya is fuming after telling them she needed three minutes. Now the chicken is undercooked, but Trenton’s team recovers quickly. Over in Megan’s kitchen, Josie is overcooking the meat and has little response as Megan screams at her.
9:50 p.m. — Josie fails to redeem herself when she delivers a raw ribeye. Megan pulls Josie from the meat station and replaces her with Steve. He does Megan proud and her team is sending out entrées to happy diners. Kiya continues to struggle at Trenton’s meat station and is slowing up the team. Trenton pulls the team into the pantry and screams at them, “Why are you trying to f*** me over?” Kiya is annoyed and says Trenton is trying to act like Gordon with his wild mood swings. Both kitchens get back on track and finish up dinner service. Gordon says the service was a little rough, but he’s ready to announce the winner of Season 20 right now. The winner is…under 25 years old! Once again he has played a cruel joke on the finalists. After reviewing the comment cards from the diners, Gordon will decide who is the most deserving young gun.
9:59 p.m. — Gordon reflects on the progress Megan and Trenton have made throughout this season. He pulls the finalists into his office and once again praises their strengths and cooking abilities. A decision has been made. Megan and Trenton both stand in front of their doors, but only one will open to a confetti-filled celebration. The winner of Season 20 of “Hell’s Kitchen” is Trenton! He will become Gordon’s protégé as well as the head chef at Gordon Ramsay Steak 2.0. Trenton is also the first male winner of “Hell’s Kitchen” since Season 12’s Scott Commings . To top things off, Trenton proposes to his girlfriend Macee. What a celebration!

NAT translates the private internal network addresses into legal, globally unique addresses before forwarding packets between the networks it connects. NAT works by mapping multiple private addresses inside a local network to a public IP address before transferring the data. It allows a single device, such as a router, to act as an agent between the Internet and a local network. NAT modifies network address information in the IP header of packets while in transit.",NAT modifies network address information in the IP header of packets while in transit.,"Network address translation ( NAT ) is a method of mapping an IP address space into another by modifying network address information in the IP header of packets while they are in transit across a traffic routing device . [1] The technique was originally used to bypass the need to assign a new address to every host when a network was moved, or when the upstream Internet service provider was replaced, but could not route the network's address space. It has become a popular and essential tool in conserving global address space in the face of IPv4 address exhaustion . One Internet-routable IP address of a NAT gateway can be used for an entire private network . [2]
As network address translation modifies the IP address information in packets, NAT implementations may vary in their specific behavior in various addressing cases and their effect on network traffic. The specifics of NAT behavior are not commonly documented by vendors of equipment containing NAT implementations. [2]
The simplest type of NAT provides a one-to-one translation of IP addresses. RFC 2663 refers to this type of NAT as basic NAT ; it is also called a one-to-one NAT . In this type of NAT, only the IP addresses, IP header checksum , and any higher-level checksums that include the IP address are changed. Basic NAT can be used to interconnect two IP networks that have incompatible addressing. [2]
The majority of network address translators map multiple private hosts to one publicly exposed IP address.
Here is a typical configuration:
- A local network uses one of the designated private IP address subnets (RFC 1918 [3] ).
- The network has a router having both a private and a public address. The private address is used by the router for communicating with other devices in the private local network. The public address (typically assigned by an Internet service provider ) is used by the router for communicating with the rest of the Internet.
- As traffic passes from the network to the Internet, the router translates the source address in each packet from a private address to the router's own public address. The router tracks basic data about each active connection (particularly the destination address and port ). When the router receives inbound traffic from the Internet, it uses the connection tracking data it stored during the outbound phase to determine to which private address (if any) it should forward the reply. [2]
All IP packets have a source IP address and a destination IP address. Typically, packets passing from the private network to the public network will have their source address modified, while packets passing from the public network back to the private network will have their destination address modified. To avoid ambiguity in how replies are translated, further modifications to the packets are required. The vast bulk of Internet traffic uses Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) or User Datagram Protocol (UDP). For these protocols, the port numbers are changed so that the combination of IP address (within the IP header ) and port number (within the Transport Layer header ) on the returned packet can be unambiguously mapped to the corresponding private network destination. RFC 2663 uses the term network address and port translation (NAPT) for this type of NAT. [3] Other names include port address translation (PAT), IP masquerading , NAT overload and many-to-one NAT . This is the most common type of NAT and has become synonymous with the term ""NAT"" in common usage.
This method allows communication through the router only when the conversation originates in the private network, since the initial originating transmission is what establishes the required information in the translation tables. Thus a web browser within the private network would be able to browse websites that are outside the network, whereas web browsers outside the network would be unable to browse a website hosted within. [a] Protocols not based on TCP and UDP require other translation techniques.
An additional benefit of one-to-many NAT is that it mitigates IPv4 address exhaustion by allowing entire networks to be connected to the Internet using a single public IP address. [b]
Network address and port translation may be implemented in several ways. Some applications that use IP address information may need to determine the external address of a network address translator. This is the address that its communication peers in the external network detect. Furthermore, it may be necessary to examine and categorize the type of mapping in use, for example when it is desired to set up a direct communication path between two clients both of which are behind separate NAT gateways.
For this purpose, RFC 3489 specified a protocol called Simple Traversal of UDP over NATs ( STUN ) in 2003. It classified NAT implementations as full-cone NAT , (address) restricted-cone NAT , port-restricted cone NAT or symmetric NAT , and proposed a methodology for testing a device accordingly. However, these procedures have since been deprecated from standards status, as the methods are inadequate to correctly assess many devices. RFC 5389 standardized new methods in 2008 and the acronym STUN now represents the new title of the specification: Session Traversal Utilities for NAT .
| Full-cone NAT , also known as one-to-one NAT |
| (Address)-restricted-cone NAT |
| Port-restricted cone NAT Like an address restricted cone NAT, but the restriction includes port numbers. |
| Symmetric NAT |
Many NAT implementations combine these types, so it is better to refer to specific individual NAT behavior instead of using the Cone/Symmetric terminology. RFC 4787 attempts to alleviate confusion by introducing standardized terminology for observed behaviors. For the first bullet in each row of the above table, the RFC would characterize Full-Cone, Restricted-Cone, and Port-Restricted Cone NATs as having an Endpoint-Independent Mapping , whereas it would characterize a Symmetric NAT as having an Address- and Port-Dependent Mapping . For the second bullet in each row of the above table, RFC 4787 would also label Full-Cone NAT as having an Endpoint-Independent Filtering , Restricted-Cone NAT as having an Address-Dependent Filtering , Port-Restricted Cone NAT as having an Address and Port-Dependent Filtering , and Symmetric NAT as having either an Address-Dependent Filtering or Address and Port-Dependent Filtering . Other classifications of NAT behavior mentioned in the RFC include whether they preserve ports, when and how mappings are refreshed, whether external mappings can be used by internal hosts (i.e., its hairpinning behavior), and the level of determinism NATs exhibit when applying all these rules. [2] Specifically, most NATs combine symmetric NAT for outgoing connections with static port mapping , where incoming packets addressed to the external address and port are redirected to a specific internal address and port.
The NAT traversal problem arises when peers behind different NATs try to communicate. One way to solve this problem is to use port forwarding . Another way is to use various NAT traversal techniques. The most popular technique for TCP NAT traversal is TCP hole punching .
TCP hole punching requires the NAT to follow the port preservation design for TCP. For a given outgoing TCP communication, the same port numbers are used on both sides of the NAT. NAT port preservation for outgoing TCP connections is crucial for TCP NAT traversal because, under TCP, one port can only be used for one communication at a time, so programs bind distinct TCP sockets to ephemeral ports for each TCP communication, rendering NAT port prediction impossible for TCP. [2]
On the other hand, for UDP, NATs do not need port preservation. Indeed, multiple UDP communications (each with a distinct endpoint ) can occur on the same source port, and applications usually reuse the same UDP socket to send packets to distinct hosts. This makes port prediction straightforward, as it is the same source port for each packet.
Furthermore, port preservation in NAT for TCP allows P2P protocols to offer less complexity and less latency because there is no need to use a third party (like STUN) to discover the NAT port since the application itself already knows the NAT port. [2] [4]
However, if two internal hosts attempt to communicate with the same external host using the same port number, the NAT may attempt to use a different external IP address for the second connection or may need to forgo port preservation and remap the port. [2] : 9
As of 2006, roughly 70% of the clients in P2P networks employed some form of NAT. [5]
Every TCP and UDP packet contains a source port number and a destination port number. Each of those packets is encapsulated in an IP packet, whose IP header contains a source IP address and a destination IP address. The IP address/protocol/port number triple defines an association with a network socket .
For publicly accessible services such as web and mail servers the port number is important. For example, port 80 connects through a socket to the web server software and port 25 to a mail server's SMTP daemon . The IP address of a public server is also important, similar in global uniqueness to a postal address or telephone number. Both IP address and port number must be correctly known by all hosts wishing to successfully communicate.
Private IP addresses as described in RFC 1918 are usable only on private networks not directly connected to the internet. Ports are endpoints of communication unique to that host, so a connection through the NAT device is maintained by the combined mapping of port and IP address. A private address on the inside of the NAT is mapped to an external public address. Port address translation (PAT) resolves conflicts that arise when multiple hosts happen to use the same source port number to establish different external connections at the same time.
A NAT device is similar to a phone system at an office that has one public telephone number and multiple extensions. Outbound phone calls made from the office all appear to come from the same telephone number. However, an incoming call that does not specify an extension cannot be automatically transferred to an individual inside the office. In this scenario, the office is a private LAN, the main phone number is the public IP address, and the individual extensions are unique port numbers. [6]
With NAT, all communications sent to external hosts actually contain the external IP address and port information of the NAT device instead of internal host IP addresses or port numbers. NAT only translates IP addresses and ports of its internal hosts, hiding the true endpoint of an internal host on a private network.
When a computer on the private (internal) network sends an IP packet to the external network, the NAT device replaces the internal source IP address in the packet header with the external IP address of the NAT device. PAT may then assign the connection a port number from a pool of available ports, inserting this port number in the source port field. The packet is then forwarded to the external network. The NAT device then makes an entry in a translation table containing the internal IP address, original source port, and the translated source port. Subsequent packets from the same internal source IP address and port number are translated to the same external source IP address and port number. The computer receiving a packet that has undergone NAT establishes a connection to the port and IP address specified in the altered packet, oblivious to the fact that the supplied address is being translated.
Upon receiving a packet from the external network, the NAT device searches the translation table based on the destination port in the packet header. If a match is found, the destination IP address and port number is replaced with the values found in the table and the packet is forwarded to the inside network. Otherwise, if the destination port number of the incoming packet is not found in the translation table, the packet is dropped or rejected because the PAT device doesn't know where to send it.
NAT operation is typically transparent to both the internal and external hosts. The NAT device may function as the default gateway for the internal host which is typically aware of the true IP address and TCP or UDP port of the external host. However, the external host is only aware of the public IP address for the NAT device and the particular port being used to communicate on behalf of a specific internal host.
IEEE Reverse Address and Port Translation (RAPT or RAT) allows a host whose real IP address changes from time to time to remain reachable as a server via a fixed home IP address. [13] Cisco 's RAPT implementation is PAT or NAT overloading and maps multiple private IP addresses to a single public IP address. Multiple addresses can be mapped to a single address because each private address is tracked by a port number. PAT uses unique source port numbers on the inside global IP address to distinguish between translations. [c] PAT attempts to preserve the original source port. If this source port is already used, PAT assigns the first available port number starting from the beginning of the appropriate port group 0–511, 512–1023, or 1024–65535. When there are no more ports available and there is more than one external IP address configured, PAT moves to the next IP address to try to allocate the original source port again. This process continues until it runs out of available ports and external IP addresses.
Mapping of Address and Port is a Cisco proposal that combines Address plus Port translation with tunneling of the IPv4 packets over an ISP provider's internal IPv6 network. In effect, it is an (almost) stateless alternative to carrier-grade NAT and DS-Lite that pushes the IPv4 address /port translation function (and the maintenance of NAT state) entirely into the existing customer premises equipment NAT implementation. Thus avoiding the NAT444 and statefulness problems of carrier-grade NAT, and also provides a transition mechanism for the deployment of native IPv6 at the same time with very little added complexity.
Hosts behind NAT-enabled routers do not have end-to-end connectivity and cannot participate in some internet protocols. Services that require the initiation of TCP connections from the outside network, or that use stateless protocols such as those using UDP , can be disrupted. Unless the NAT router makes a specific effort to support such protocols, incoming packets cannot reach their destination. Some protocols can accommodate one instance of NAT between participating hosts (""passive mode"" FTP , for example), sometimes with the assistance of an application-level gateway (see § Applications affected by NAT ), but fail when both systems are separated from the internet by NAT. The use of NAT also complicates tunneling protocols such as IPsec because NAT modifies values in the headers which interfere with the integrity checks done by IPsec and other tunneling protocols.
End-to-end connectivity has been a core principle of the Internet, supported, for example, by the Internet Architecture Board . Current Internet architectural documents observe that NAT is a violation of the end-to-end principle , but that NAT does have a valid role in careful design. [14] There is considerably more concern with the use of IPv6 NAT, and many IPv6 architects believe IPv6 was intended to remove the need for NAT. [15]
An implementation that only tracks ports can be quickly depleted by internal applications that use multiple simultaneous connections such as an HTTP request for a web page with many embedded objects. This problem can be mitigated by tracking the destination IP address in addition to the port thus sharing a single local port with many remote hosts. This additional tracking increases implementation complexity and computing resources at the translation device.
Because the internal addresses are all disguised behind one publicly accessible address, it is impossible for external hosts to directly initiate a connection to a particular internal host. Applications such as VOIP , videoconferencing , and other peer-to-peer applications must use NAT traversal techniques to function.
Pure NAT, operating on IP alone, may or may not correctly parse protocols with payloads containing information about IP, such as ICMP . This depends on whether the payload is interpreted by a host on the inside or outside of the translation. Basic protocols as TCP and UDP cannot function properly unless NAT takes action beyond the network layer.
IP packets have a checksum in each packet header, which provides error detection only for the header. IP datagrams may become fragmented and it is necessary for a NAT to reassemble these fragments to allow correct recalculation of higher-level checksums and correct tracking of which packets belong to which connection.
TCP and UDP, have a checksum that covers all the data they carry, as well as the TCP or UDP header, plus a pseudo-header that contains the source and destination IP addresses of the packet carrying the TCP or UDP header. For an originating NAT to pass TCP or UDP successfully, it must recompute the TCP or UDP header checksum based on the translated IP addresses, not the original ones, and put that checksum into the TCP or UDP header of the first packet of the fragmented set of packets.
Alternatively, the originating host may perform path MTU Discovery to determine the packet size that can be transmitted without fragmentation and then set the don't fragment (DF) bit in the appropriate packet header field. This is only a one-way solution, because the responding host can send packets of any size, which may be fragmented before reaching the NAT.
Destination network address translation (DNAT) is a technique for transparently changing the destination IP address of a routed packet and performing the inverse function for any replies. Any router situated between two endpoints can perform this transformation of the packet.
DNAT is commonly used to publish a service located in a private network on a publicly accessible IP address. This use of DNAT is also called port forwarding , or DMZ when used on an entire server , which becomes exposed to the WAN, becoming analogous to an undefended military demilitarized zone (DMZ).
The meaning of the term SNAT varies by vendor: [16] [17] [18]
- source NAT is a common expansion and is the counterpart of destination NAT ( DNAT ). This is used to describe one-to-many NAT; NAT for outgoing connections to public services.
- stateful NAT is used by Cisco Systems [19]
- static NAT is used by WatchGuard [20]
- secure NAT is used by F5 Networks [21] and by Microsoft (in regard to the ISA Server )
Secure network address translation (SNAT) is part of Microsoft's Internet Security and Acceleration Server and is an extension to the NAT driver built into Microsoft Windows Server . It provides connection tracking and filtering for the additional network connections needed for the FTP , ICMP , H.323 , and PPTP protocols as well as the ability to configure a transparent HTTP proxy server .
Dynamic NAT, just like static NAT, is not common in smaller networks but is found within larger corporations with complex networks. Where static NAT provides a one-to-one internal to public static IP address mapping, dynamic NAT uses a group of public IP addresses. [22] [23]
NAT hairpinning , also known as NAT loopback or NAT reflection , [24] is a feature in many consumer routers [25] where a machine on the LAN is able to access another machine on the LAN via the external IP address of the LAN/router (with port forwarding set up on the router to direct requests to the appropriate machine on the LAN). This notion is officially described in 2008, RFC 5128 .
The following describes an example network:
- Public address: 203.0.113.1 . This is the address of the WAN interface on the router.
- Internal address of router: 192.168.1.1
- Address of the server: 192.168.1.2
- Address of a local computer: 192.168.1.100
If a packet is sent to 203.0.113.1 by a computer at 192.168.1.100 , the packet would normally be routed to the default gateway (the router) [d] A router with the NAT loopback feature detects that 203.0.113.1 is the address of its WAN interface, and treats the packet as if coming from that interface. It determines the destination for that packet, based on DNAT (port forwarding) rules for the destination. If the data were sent to port 80 and a DNAT rule exists for port 80 directed to 192.168.1.2 , then the host at that address receives the packet.
If no applicable DNAT rule is available, the router drops the packet. An ICMP Destination Unreachable reply may be sent. If any DNAT rules were present, address translation is still in effect; the router still rewrites the source IP address in the packet. The local computer ( 192.168.1.100 ) sends the packet as coming from 192.168.1.100 , but the server ( 192.168.1.2 ) receives it as coming from 203.0.113.1 . When the server replies, the process is identical to an external sender. Thus, two-way communication is possible between hosts inside the LAN network via the public IP address.
Network address translation is not commonly used in IPv6 because one of the design goals of IPv6 is to restore end-to-end network connectivity. [26] The large addressing space of IPv6 obviates the need to conserve addresses and every device can be given a unique globally routable address. Use of unique local addresses in combination with network prefix translation can achieve results similar to NAT.
The large addressing space of IPv6 can still be defeated depending on the actual prefix length given by the carrier. It is not uncommon to be handed a /64 prefix – the smallest recommended subnet – for an entire home network, requiring a variety of techniques to be used to manually subdivide the range for all devices to remain reachable. [27] Even actual IPv6-to-IPv6 NAT, NAT66, can turn out useful at times: the APNIC blog outlines a case where the author was only provided a single address (/128). [28]
Some application layer protocols, such as File Transfer Protocol (FTP) and Session Initiation Protocol (SIP), send explicit network addresses within their application data. FTP in active mode, for example, uses separate connections for control traffic (commands) and for data traffic (file contents). When requesting a file transfer, the host making the request identifies the corresponding data connection by its network layer and transport layer addresses. If the host making the request lies behind a simple NAT firewall, the translation of the IP address or TCP port number makes the information received by the server invalid. SIP commonly controls voice over IP calls, and suffer the same problem. SIP and its accompanying Session Description Protocol may use multiple ports to set up a connection and transmit voice stream via Real-time Transport Protocol . IP addresses and port numbers are encoded in the payload data and must be known before the traversal of NATs. Without special techniques, such as STUN , NAT behavior is unpredictable and communications may fail. Application Layer Gateway (ALG) software or hardware may correct these problems. An ALG software module running on a NAT firewall device updates any payload data made invalid by address translation. ALGs need to understand the higher-layer protocol that they need to fix, and so each protocol with this problem requires a separate ALG. For example, on many Linux systems, there are kernel modules called connection trackers that serve to implement ALGs. However, ALG cannot work if the protocol data is encrypted.
Another possible solution to this problem is to use NAT traversal techniques using protocols such as STUN or Interactive Connectivity Establishment (ICE), or proprietary approaches in a session border controller . NAT traversal is possible in both TCP- and UDP-based applications, but the UDP-based technique is simpler, more widely understood, and more compatible with legacy NATs. [ citation needed ] In either case, the high-level protocol must be designed with NAT traversal in mind, and it does not work reliably across symmetric NATs or other poorly behaved legacy NATs.
Other possibilities are Internet Gateway Device Protocol , NAT Port Mapping Protocol (NAT-PMP), or Port Control Protocol (PCP), [29] but these require the NAT device to implement that protocol.
Most client–server protocols (FTP being the main exception [e] ), however, do not send layer 3 contact information and do not require any special treatment by NATs. In fact, avoiding NAT complications is practically a requirement when designing new higher-layer protocols today.
NATs can also cause problems where IPsec encryption is applied and in cases where multiple devices such as SIP phones are located behind a NAT. Phones that encrypt their signaling with IPsec encapsulate the port information within an encrypted packet, meaning that NAT devices cannot access and translate the port. In these cases, the NAT devices revert to simple NAT operations. This means that all traffic returning to the NAT is mapped onto one client, causing service to more than one client behind the NAT to fail. There are a couple of solutions to this problem: one is to use TLS , which operates at layer 4 and does not mask the port number; another is to encapsulate the IPsec within UDP – the latter being the solution chosen by TISPAN to achieve secure NAT traversal, or a NAT with ""IPsec Passthru"" support; another is to use a session border controller to help traverse the NAT.
Interactive Connectivity Establishment is a NAT traversal technique that does not rely on ALG support.
The DNS protocol vulnerability announced by Dan Kaminsky on July 8, 2008, [30] is indirectly affected by NAT port mapping. To avoid DNS cache poisoning , it is highly desirable not to translate UDP source port numbers of outgoing DNS requests from a DNS server behind a firewall that implements NAT. The recommended workaround for the DNS vulnerability is to make all caching DNS servers use randomized UDP source ports. If the NAT function de-randomizes the UDP source ports, the DNS server becomes vulnerable.

This feature is often referred to as static NAT . It may be implemented in two types: port forwarding which forwards traffic from a specific external port to an internal host on a specified port, and designation of a DMZ host which passes all traffic received on the external interface (on any port number) to an internal IP address while preserving the destination port. Both types may be available in the same NAT device.

Jehan Daruvala was announced as a driver for the Red Bull Junior Team in February 2020, taking him one step closer to fulfilling his F1 dream.
The Red Bull Junior Team has produced the likes of four-time world champion Sebastian Vettel, Max Verstappen, Daniel Ricciardo, and many others. The current drivers of Red Bull Racing and Scuderia AlphaTauri for the 2020 F1 season have all been graduates of the Red Bull Junior Team.
Additionally, India’s only two F1 drivers – Narain Karthikeyan and Karun Chandhok – have been supported by the team in the past. Jehan hopes to follow in their footsteps to become the third Indian in Formula One.
For the 2020 season, he will be racing in F2 with the Carlin team. We caught up with him ahead of the season to discuss his career and how hopefuls could follow his path to a F1 seat.
Here are Jehan Daruvala’s tips for anyone looking to become a professional racer.
For someone aspiring to become an F1 driver, it is mandatory to put in five to seven years in competitive karting according to Jehan Daruvala.
“Karting is essential to teach you the race craft required in your single seater,” says Jehan.
“Just because you are one of the best in karting you need not be one of the best in single seaters. However, if you have to be good in single seaters you need to have had a very good karting career,” he adds.
While Jehan feels the Indian karting competitions are great, he says competing in the European circuits is a true indicator of F1 potential.
“In India, you get about 10 to 15 competitors. In Asia, that may go up to 30, while in Europe you very often see grids of 60-plus drivers,” Jehan says, adding that regularly ranking within European karting’s top-10 shows that you have the potential for an F1 seat.
Jehan says that having a mentor is important because they can steer you away from the pitfalls that you may unknowingly encounter due to lack of knowledge and experience in motorsport.
“I was fortunate to have Rayomand Banajee support me through my formative years in India and Asia,” says Jehan.

As you move from karting to single seaters, it becomes important to be in the right teams. The single seater structure is such that the junior teams work with the best performing drivers and in turn help them stay on top of the competition; it is a self-fulfilling situation, as Jehan puts it.
“If you make it to a top team, you need to be mentally prepared to have the best drivers as your teammates. This is a very good situation to be in as you get to learn a lot driving in the same team as them, and if you are quicker than your teammates, then you get noticed [by F1 teams] very quickly,” says Jehan.

Apart from developing quickly, moving to European competitions can help fund your racing career easier. Since Europe has a long history of motorsports – and F3 and F2 races are broadcast live in most European countries – the chances of getting sponsors are higher once you start racing in Europe.
It might not always be feasible to jump into a single seater when you want to practice. Jehan suggests working on simulators since they help quite a bit – especially if you are trying to learn a new circuit you haven’t raced on before.
“Getting back in a kart also keeps the skills honed and is always fun,” says Jehan.
No professional racer ever endorses street racing because it is dangerous and detrimental to a racing career. Jehan says that street racing is irresponsible and safety is always the most important measure of racing.
“On road driving will never help you go faster on the race track, so there is no point trying to speed on the streets,” says Jehan.
Jehan says that fitness is very crucial in professional racing. Strength is important to be able to handle the car and endurance is important to help you sustain long periods of time in the car at high speeds at full focus.
“As you progress through the rungs building neck strength is the key as the higher formula cars pull up to 3-4 Gs at high speed,” advises Jehan. Apart from strength training, Jehan does cardio in the form of running, cycling and swimming.
Discipline in terms of diet is extremely important for a racecar driver. Jehan says being fit, lean, and mentally sharp help drivers deal with different situations on the track. He says food and nutrition go a long way in helping with mental sharpness.
Jehan says that above everything else, a talented driver needs to be committed to the sport if they want to make it to F1.
""You have to be prepared to be away from family, home and friends, sometimes from a very young age. It’s also important to work on a positive attitude and mental strength as motorsport involves a lot of ups and downs, some which are beyond your control. It thus always helps to take things positively, learn from them and move forward,” says Jehan.

This document is called a life estate deed.","To set up a life estate, the grantor must create a written document that indicates they are transferring ownership of the property to another person for the duration of their life.","According to both common and statutory law, a life estate definition would be a form of joint property ownership. It allows one person to remain in their home until their death, at which time the home passes to the other owner. A legal life estate is created by the person who owns the property (or, the grantor), and it is given to the recipient (or, grantee).
A life estate example would be if an adult child states in their estate planning documents that they grant their named parent the right to live in their real property, until the parent’s death. Another example would be including that the named parent may also receive rental income from the grantor’s property, until the grantee’s death.
Life estates are most commonly utilized to convey property between relatives, or close friends. These arrangements are useful for situations in which the property may be used by another for an extended period of time, but the owner wishes for the property to revert to their own possession for legal purposes. The most attractive feature of a life estate is the fact that the property will return to the original grantor, which is referred to as a “reversion.”
As such, the holder of a life estate is generally entitled to use the property during their lifetime; however, they will not be able to transfer it to their own heirs upon their death.
It is relatively simple to create a life estate. The grantor will need to create a written document in which they indicate that they are conveying property for the length of someone else’s life. A conveyance is the transfer of an interest in real property, such as a home or commercial real estate. Conveyance occurs when a grantor uses words of conveyance in order to transfer an interest in property to a grantee. Therefore, a life estate is a type of conveyance and is created in much the same way.
Generally speaking, the writing used will take the form of the following language: “I, Party A, convey my real property to Party B, for life.” This writing is usually contained within a deed or a will . It is important to note that the exact language requirements for creating a life estate may differ between states.
A life estate can be terminated upon the death of the tenant, or grantee. However, life estates can also be cut short. This can happen in several ways, some examples of which include:
- The life tenant commits impermissible waste, or, “overt and willful acts of destruction” leading to the drop in property value; or
- The life tenant violates a condition that has been attached to the life estate. Grantors may attach any written conditions that they wish to the conveyance of a life estate, so long as the conditions are not unlawful. An example of this would be how a life estate conveyance may read, “To Party B for life, provided that Party B maintains the inground swimming pool located on the premises and keeps it in good repair.” Party B has a life estate, and will maintain that life estate, for as long as Party B abides by the condition placed by the grantor.
The most common type of life estate, which is the type created by words of conveyance, is measured by the grantee’s life. When the life tenant (or, Party B) dies, Party A has the right of reversion. What this means is that upon Party B’s death, the property reverts back to Party A. If at that point Party A has also died, the property goes to Party A’s heirs.
Some life estates are also known as “life estates pur autre vie.” “Pur autre vie” means “by someone else’s life.” Once again, such estates are created by a grantor conveying the property to another. To continue the example, this would be “To Party B.” However, Party B’s lifetime would not be the unit of measurement for how long Party B holds the life estate. Rather, another person’s lifetime would be how the length of the life estate is to be measured.
In general, a life estate pur autre vie reads, “I, Party A, convey the property to Party B, for the life of Party C.” It is when Party C dies, not when Party B dies, that Party B’s life estate would be terminated. At that time, the property would then revert to Party A. Party C is referred to as the “measuring life,” because their life serves as the measurement of the duration of Party B’s life estate.

During the duration of the life estate, a life tenant is generally entitled to all uses and profits from the land. The purpose of these obligations is to not impair the rights of those who will own the property subsequent to the life tenant’s ownership.
However, because the life tenant does not have any rights to transfer the property when the life tenant dies, they may not commit waste . In legal terms, there are three different kinds of waste. The first is referred to as voluntary or affirmative waste, as previously mentioned. This type of waste is any act that causes the property to lose value.
Generally speaking, a life tenant may not commit “permissive waste”. What this means is that the life tenant may not neglect their obligation to keep the premises in reasonably good repair.
The third type of waste is known as “ameliorative waste.” This refers to engaging in acts that will enhance the property’s value. The rules governing ameliorative waste differ between states. While some states require that any property changes are only to be made with the consent of the grantor or any other party who may have an interest in the property, other states are more lenient. These states have determined that the life tenant may make reasonable improvements, as long as the grantor or anyone else with an interest in the estate does not object to the improvements.
The life tenant has other duties in addition to the duty not to commit waste. These duties generally include:
- Ensuring all ordinary taxes on the land are paid, in terms of income or profits from the property;
- Ensuring that real estate taxes are paid; and
- Protecting the property from liens or other encumbrances.
If you wish to create or terminate a life estate, you should consult with an experienced local estate lawyer . As you can see, state laws can vary widely in terms of how a life estate may be governed. Because of this, someone local to you will best understand your state’s laws regarding the matter and how those laws may affect your legal options. An experienced attorney can help you legally create and/or terminate a life estate, as well as represent you in court, as needed.
Alternatively, if you are the recipient of a life estate, an attorney can represent you should any disputes arise. They will protect your rights throughout the process, and will provide any defense available should you be accused of violating a life estate.",source_text/ef2a23594c5d286e7697ac96792ae1d1c9b0e326576c91caaa70fd6b1fa21ff5-perplexity_0_0.txt,The grantor will need to create a written document in which they indicate that they are conveying property for the length of someone else’s life.,complete_support,False,clubs - estate - botswana - virgin - active - namibia - deed - africa - property - 136,StanfordCitation,0.62,0.5766666666666668,0.56,0.55,[0.9789365530014038],[0.9789365530014038]

These cravings can last for up to 10 minutes and can be difficult to cope with. To reduce nicotine cravings, it is important to seek help from a doctor, a cessation counselor, or a support group, and to take steps to reduce the amount of nicotine in the body.",These cravings can last for up to 10 minutes and can be difficult to cope with.,"Many smokers fear nicotine withdrawal symptoms when embarking on a smoking cessation plan . In fact, these symptoms are one of the main reasons why quitting smoking (or other forms of tobacco) is so difficult. 1 From cravings to muscle and joint pain after quitting smoking, withdrawal symptoms can make the process more challenging.
This experience can be a distressing experience for some, triggering a host of physical and psychological symptoms. But it doesn't mean that everyone will experience withdrawal in the same way.
For example, people who quit ""cold turkey"" tend to have more severe nicotine withdrawal symptoms than those using an approach that involves counseling, support systems, and quit-smoking aids such as nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) . 2
You can experience nicotine withdrawal symptoms no matter what type of nicotine you're quitting—whether smoking, vaping, chewing tobacco, or any other form of tobacco use.
Nicotine withdrawal refers to what happens in the body when someone who has been using nicotine regularly stops or reduces their intake. 3 This reduction or elimination of nicotine can result in experiencing nicotine withdrawal symptoms that are physical and psychological in nature. 4
As far as a timeline is concerned, nicotine withdrawal symptoms can begin within two to three hours after you last used this drug. Though, they are often strongest a few days after stopping nicotine completely.
The Diagnostic Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition (DSM-5) outlines the criteria for tobacco withdrawal. The title of this condition was changed from ""nicotine withdrawal,"" which is what it was called in the DSM-IV. 5
The nicotine withdrawal symptoms discussed here are not all the same criteria as listed in the DSM-5. 6
By understanding some of the signs and symptoms of nicotine withdrawal, you can better prepare for them and know how to respond if and when they occur. Here are a few of the most common, along with several ways to avoid them.
While nicotine withdrawal symptoms can be challenging, it's important to remember that these effects are only temporary. With a little preparation and persistence, you will get through them.
1
Smoking urges, commonly known as nicotine cravings , are one of the most challenging and persistent nicotine withdrawal symptoms. The cravings you feel are caused by nicotinic receptors in the brain. 7
A craving is a physiological response in which the body yearns for something to which it has adapted and become tolerant. When suddenly deprived of nicotine, the brain no longer releases the ""feel-good"" hormone dopamine , which the body has grown accustomed to.
Nicotine cravings typically last for five to 10 minutes and may be extremely uncomfortable. To cope with this nicotine withdrawal symptom, remind yourself that the feeling will pass. Chewing nicotine gum or taking a long, brisk walk can also help as you wait them out.
2
The urge to snack is a nicotine withdrawal symptom that involves more than just replacing cigarettes with food. Nicotine causes changes to cells that make them not respond as well to insulin, which can increase your body's blood sugar levels. 8
As a result, when quitting smoking, you may feel the need to consume carbs, or crave sweets and other foods to satiate this sudden and often unexplained hunger. Thankfully, this effect will stabilize as your body adjusts to being nicotine-free. 8
Research shows that people who quit cigarettes gain an average of 10 pounds after one year, with most of the gain occurring during the first three months. 9
In the meantime, to keep from gaining weight when quitting smoking, it helps to control your snacking. Do something to distract yourself instead eating, such as engaging in physical exercise.
And if you do snack, choose healthy foods that won't contribute to weight gain. Fruits and vegetables are good options to consider.
3
Sleep problems are common nicotine withdrawal symptoms and can run the gamut from insomnia to needing extra sleep during the day. These symptoms are also closely linked to the dysregulation of dopamine, which is involved in sleep regulation.
While sleep disturbances and insomnia are symptoms of nicotine withdrawal, research has indicated that smokers tend to experience worse sleep than non-smokers. 10
To relieve insomnia when quitting smoking , consider any other factors that may be contributing to your sleep issues. If you drink caffeine later in the day, for instance, changing this habit can make it easier to get and stay asleep.
It can also be helpful to develop a pre-sleep routine that helps you relax. This might involve ending your day with a nice bath or reading a few pages in your favorite book to help calm your mind.
4
Some people develop a persistent cough after they quit smoking. 11 This can cause you to feel worse instead of better. As odd as this may seem, coughing at this stage is a sign that your lungs are getting better.
When you smoke, the tiny finger-like projections in the lining of your airways (called cilia) become immobilized and eventually flatten out. After you quit, the cilia return to their normal shape and function, pushing toxic deposits out of the lungs to be coughed up.
You can avoid this nicotine withdrawal symptom by staying well-hydrated and humidifying the air in your environment. It can also be helpful to use honey or an over-the-counter cough drop to ease any throat irritation.
5
While in the process of quitting, you may experience something popularly referred to as "" quitter's flu ."" 12 This is characterized by a mild fever, malaise, sinusitis, coughing, and body aches, and is simply your body's response to an unfamiliar state. Muscle and joint pain after quitting smoking are common sympoms of the quitter's flu.
The sudden cessation of smoking can trigger an immune response, causing it to react in much the same way as it would to bacteria or a virus it considers abnormal.
In most cases, quitter's flu will last for only a couple of days. Nicotine replacement therapy, along with over-the-counter pain relievers, may help ease these symptoms.
6
Stress and irritation are common symptoms of early nicotine withdrawal. They are triggered by the profound dysregulation of the endocrine (hormonal) and central nervous systems. 13
This stress can not only cause extreme changes in mood, including sudden and irrational outbursts, but it can also trigger short-term physiological changes such as increased blood pressure and heart rate.
Memory problems, difficulty concentrating, and dizziness are also common. So are feelings of anxiety, which often occur within three days of quitting but may last several weeks. 14
These psychological symptoms can worsen if you are sleep-deprived, further leading to bouts of anxiety or depression .
Finding ways to reduce your stress when quitting smoking can help avoid this common nicotine withdrawal symptom. This may involve journaling, talking with a friend, or finding a physical activity that you enjoy.
7
In addition to the lungs and brain, the digestive tract can also be affected when you stop smoking. Stopping the use of nicotine alters the motility and contraction of the intestines, dramatically slowing the speed by which food is digested.
Older research revealed that as many as one in six people who quit cigarettes experience bouts of constipation , and it generally lasts for one to two weeks. 15
This effect may be further exacerbated by the ""munchies"" some people experience while quitting. Increased food cravings can increase the volume of food you eat, along with increasing your intake of foods more likely to cause constipation—such as white bread, chocolate, potato chips, and ice cream.
Drinking plenty of water can help normalize your bowel movements. Increasing your intake of dietary fiber may reduce this nicotine withdrawal symptom as well.
Nicotine withdrawal occurs because the body has become dependent on this drug. 16 Specifically, nicotine stimulates the release of dopamine in your brain. So, when you stop using it, there is less dopamine released, resulting in withdrawal symptoms. 3 (Nicotine affects other neurotransmitters as well.)
While nicotine withdrawal can be uncomfortable, it does make your body healthier versus hurting it.
Behavioral factors are also thought to influence nicotine withdrawal symptoms. For example, just seeing someone smoking or smelling a cigarette can increase your cravings to do the same. 17
There are a few treatments to help with nicotine withdrawal, including:
- Nicotine replacement therapies (NRTs) : Examples of NRTs include nicotine gum, patches , and lozenges , all of which are available over the counter. Nicotine nasal sprays and inhalers are available with a prescription. 18
- Prescription medications : The antidepressant Zyban (bupropion) (also sold under the brand name Wellbutrin) and the smoking cessation aid Chantix (varenicline) can help with nicotine withdrawal symptoms. 19
Speak to a healthcare provider about what treatment might be best for you. In addition to medications and NRTs, you can also seek psychological support from a support group, quit-tobacco program, or mental health professional. 20

Nicotine withdrawal symptoms can be intense and uncomfortable. But this phase of smoking cessation won't last forever . And, if prepared, you can manage and cope with the symptoms as they come.
In the end, the benefits of quitting far outweigh any short-term discomfort you may experience through withdrawal. If you take it one step at a time, you'll get there. Try not to get ahead of yourself and worry about never smoking again. Just focus on today and do whatever you can to remain smoke-free .
- Does quitting smoking make your muscles ache?
Yes, quitting smoking can lead to muscle ache and joint pain. This is often referred to as the ""quitter's flu"" and can also include symptoms such as fever, stuffy nose, coughing, and lack of energy.
- Can quitting smoking cause inflammation?
Smoking is associated with increased inflammation, so quitting smoking can lead to significant improvements. This can take time, but it contributes to a decreased risk of cardiovascular disease. 21
- How long does it take for inflammation to go away after quitting smoking?
One study reports that inflammation begins to subside just two weeks after quitting. 22 Other research suggests that the inflammatory response associated with smoking returns to normal within five years of quitting. 23
- How long after quitting smoking does your body go back to normal?
The health benefits of quitting are progressive and can take time, but start almost immediately after quitting. Within 20 minutes, your heart rate and blood pressure drop. A year after quitting, the cilia in your lung regain their normal function. By two years, your risk of heart attacks drops significantly. Between five and 10 years, your risk of different cancers drops dramatically. By 15 years after quitting, your risk of coronary heart disease has dropped to almost that of a non-smoker. 24

On September 17th, 1991, Guns N’ Roses released their third and fourth albums, Use Your Illusion I and II . To celebrate their 30th anniversaries, here are 50 things you might not know about the records:
1. The covers of Use Your Illusion I and II feature the same detail from Raphael ’s painting The School of Athens . They were done by Estonian-American artist Mark Kostabi , who used a yellow and red color scheme for Use Your Illusion I and a purple and blue one for II .
2. The albums took the name of the paintings used for the cover art, which the artist’s brother, Paul Kostabi , titled Use Your Illusion .
3. Somewhat hidden in the liner notes is the phrase “F*** You St. Louis,” a reference to the band’s performance there in July of 1991. Axl Rose cut their set short and caused a riot, an act that the city charged him for.
4. Slash is thanked in the liner notes for “the killer guitar melodies.”
5. The albums came out at midnight on September 17th, 1991. The band sold 500,000 copies of them in just two hours, even though stores like K-Mart and Walmart refused to sell the records because they contained profanity.
6. After mixing 21 tracks with engineer/producer Bob Clearmountain , the band wasn’t happy with how things sounded so they scrapped them all and started again with Sex Pistols engineer Bill Price .
7. The albums marked the first time other members of the band took on lead vocal duties. Guitarist Izzy Stradlin sang “Dust N’ Bones,” “You Ain’t the First,” “Double Talkin’ Jive” and “14 Years,” while bassist Duff McKagan voiced “So Fine.”
8. The song “Right Next Door to Hell” came from Axl’s beef with his neighbor, Gabriella Kantor . She had the singer arrested, accusing him of hitting her with a wine bottle. He denied the charge and called her a crazed fan. The condo was later given away in MTV’s Evict Axl contest.
9. The band’s version of Wings ’ “Live and Let Die” was nominated for the 1993 Grammy for Best Hard Rock Performance.
10. “Don’t Cry” is about a girl named Monique Lewis , whose face is tattooed on Axl’s right bicep. She was once his girlfriend and was also once romantically linked to Izzy.
11. Two versions of “Don’t Cry” appear on the albums. They both have the same instrumentation, but the lyrics are totally different and the melody is also altered. A third version of the track was also recorded during Appetite for Destruction sessions. It came out as part of the “Don’t Cry” single.
12. “Bad Obsession” is about overcoming drug addiction.
13. Hanoi Rocks singer Michael Monroe , who heavily influenced GN’R, played harmonica and saxophone on “Bad Obsession.”
14. “Back Off Bitch” is in part about Gina Siler , Axl’s girlfriend who moved to LA with him in 1982, but in 1983 kicked him out over his anger issues. The track was actually penned before Appetite came out.
15. The song “Double Talkin’ Jive” features the line “found a head and an arm in a garbage can.” It refers to police actually discovering those body parts in a Dumpster near the band’s studio.
16. At eight minutes and 57 seconds, “November Rain” is the longest song ever to make it to the top ten of the Billboard Hot 100, where it peaked at number three.
17. Axl’s former Hollywood Rose bandmate, Tracii Guns , said Axl had been working on “November Rain” since at least 1983, because he remembered hearing him play it back then. Axl told him, “Someday this song is gonna be really cool,” but added that it wasn’t yet finished.
18. The band thought Axl’s voice on “The Garden” sounded so much like Alice Cooper ’s that they invited the shock rocker to help out on the song. He accepted and appears on the track.
19. The band wrote “Garden of Eden” while they were rehearsing in Chicago.
20. Axl wrote the acoustic guitar riff at the beginning of “Dead Horse.” The song also features the sound of a nutcracker.
21. Slash and Axl wrote “Coma” about their drug overdoses. Axl once said the end segment of the track is “one of the best things that [he’s] ever written.”
22. Clocking in at 10 minutes and 14 seconds, “Coma” is Guns N’ Roses’ longest song.
23. “Civil War” is the last GN’R song to feature drummer Steven Adler , who was kicked out of the band due to his drug addictions before they made the albums.
24. “Civil War” is a protest song on war and includes the line, “What’s so civil about war, anyway?”
25. Some of the lyrics of “Civil War” reflect a peace march that Duff went to with his mom when he was four years old.
26. “Civil War” first appeared on the 1990 compilation Nobody’s Child: Romanian Angel Appeal .
27. “14 Years” is about a guy who has had a long, tough relationship with a girl and expresses how he feels in the song. Izzy wrote it at a very young age, before he ever could have had that kind of relationship, so it’s not about him.
28. There are rumors that “14 Years” is about Izzy’s friendship with Axl, since they’d reportedly known each other for 14 years when the song was written, but this concept doesn’t fit the lyrics and it’s never been confirmed by the band.
29. GN’R’s cover of Bob Dylan ’s “Knockin’ on Heaven’s Door” actually came out a year earlier on the Days of Thunder soundtrack.
30. “Get In The Ring” was written about critics who gave the band bad reviews because of how they act on stage. GN’R actually name-dropped four critics in the song. One of those critics accepted Axl’s offer to “get in the ring” and challenged Rose to a boxing match, but it never happened.
31. “Get In The Ring” was originally called “Why Do You Look at Me When You Hate Me,” which instead became the song’s first line.
32. “Get In The Ring” was also almost titled “Get In The Ring Motherf***er.”
33. “Get In The Ring” is renowned for how much swearing is in the song.
34. The version of “Get In The Ring” on the album sounds live but it’s not. The band recorded it in the studio and added crowd noises to it. The crowd noises came from a June 10, 1991 gig in Saratoga Springs, New York.
35. “Pretty Tied Up” begins with Izzy playing a coral sitar.
36. Slash said that Izzy was so high on heroin when they wrote “Pretty Tied Up” that he made a sitar out of a cymbal, a broomstick and strings.
37. Izzy was inspired to write “Pretty Tied Up” after seeing a dominatrix. He and a buddy went to meet her and at her house, she had a fat man in women’s underwear and high heels, tied up with duct tape against a wall with an onion in his mouth.
38. “So Fine” was dedicated to punk rocker Johnny Thunders , who died of a drug overdose before the albums were recorded.
39. “Estranged” is GN’R’s second longest song.
40. Axl said he penned “Estranged” during a more “bummed out” period of his life after his marriage to Erin Everly was annulled.
41. Slash said that “Breakdown” was one of the harder songs to record since the banjo, piano and drum parts were difficult to synchronize and new drummer Matt Sorum got frustrated trying to get it just right.
42. “You Could Be Mine” is about Izzy’s failed relationship with his ex-girlfriend, Angela Nicoletti .
43. “You Could Be Mine” was featured in the 1991 film Terminator 2: Judgment Day , but it didn’t make it onto the soundtrack.
44. The “You Could Be Mine” lyric “With your bitch slap rappin’ and your cocaine tongue you get nothin’ done” appears on the inner sleeve of Appetite for Destruction .

46. Axl said that “My World” was written in three hours.
47. The band was reportedly on mushrooms when they recorded “My World.” Axl said he didn’t even know since a friend of him slipped the drugs into his tea.
48. Blind Melon singer Shannon Hoon contributed backing vocals to “Live and Let Die,” “November Rain,” “The Garden,” “You Ain’t the First” and “Don’t Cry.”
49. Use Your Illusion II debuted at number one on the album chart, selling 770,000 copies in its first week. Use Your Illusion I took the two spot, moving 685,000 units in a week.
50. Both Use Your Illusion albums have been certified seven times platinum in America and together have worldwide sales in excess of 39,000,000 copies.",source_text/87035f40ae664d4abcd9e20e02df220c8700a5d719581118228846c8904fdd8f-perplexity_2_0.txt,"hey both have the same instrumentation, but the lyrics are totally different and the melody is also altered.",complete_support,False,song - sang - wrote - sings - movie - played - plays - blood - released - original,StanfordCitation,0.54,0.4566666666666667,0.43,0.4,[0.9735801219940186],[0.9735801219940186]

They answer to the government, not a political party. Although they were once literally personal servants of monarchs, their role has evolved over time. Civil servants are responsible for a wide range of government activities, but they are not representatives of governments or other entities.","They answer to the government, not a political party.","From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia
For the British institution, see Civil Service (United Kingdom) . For the album, see Civil Service (album) .
The civil service is a collective term for a sector of government composed mainly of career civil servants hired rather than appointed or elected, whose institutional tenure typically survives transitions of political leadership. A civil servant , also known as a public servant , is a person employed in the public sector by a government department or agency for public sector undertakings. Civil servants work for central and state governments, and answer to the government, not a political party. [1] [2]
The extent of civil servants of a state as part of the ""civil service"" varies from country to country. In the United Kingdom (UK), for instance, only Crown (national government) employees are referred to as ""civil servants"" whereas employees of local authorities (counties, cities and similar administrations) are generally referred to as ""local government civil service officers"", who are considered public servants but not civil servants. Thus, in the UK, a civil servant is a public servant but a public servant is not necessarily a civil servant.
The study of the civil service is a part of the field of public service (and in some countries there is no distinction between the two). Staff members in ""non-departmental public bodies"" (sometimes called "" QUANGOs "") may also be classed as civil servants for the purpose of statistics and possibly for their terms and conditions. Collectively a state's civil servants form its civil service or public service. The concept arose in China and modern civil service developed in Britain in the 18th century.
An international civil servant or international staff member is a civilian employee who is employed by an intergovernmental organization . These international civil servants do not resort under any national legislation (from which they have immunity of jurisdiction ) but are governed by internal staff regulations. All disputes related to international civil service are brought before special tribunals created by these international organizations such as, for instance, the Administrative Tribunal of the ILO . Specific referral can be made to the International Civil Service Commission (ICSC) of the United Nations , an independent expert body established by the United Nations General Assembly . Its mandate is to regulate and coordinate the conditions of service of staff in the United Nations common system, while promoting and maintaining high standards in the international civil service.
The origin of the modern meritocratic civil service can be traced back to Imperial examination founded in Imperial China . [3] The Imperial exam based on merit was designed to select the best administrative officials for the state's bureaucracy. [4] This system had a huge influence on both society and culture in Imperial China and was directly responsible for the creation of a class of scholar-bureaucrats irrespective of their family pedigree. [5]
Originally appointments to the bureaucracy were based on the patronage of aristocrats ; During the Han dynasty , Emperor Wu of Han established the xiaolian system of recommendation by superiors for appointments to office. In the areas of administration, especially the military, appointments were based solely on merit. This was an early form of the imperial examinations, transitioning from inheritance and patronage to merit, in which local officials would select candidates to take part in an examination of the Confucian classics . [5] After the fall of the Han dynasty, the Chinese bureaucracy regressed into a semi-merit system known as the nine-rank system .
This system was reversed during the short-lived Sui dynasty (581–618), which initiated a civil service bureaucracy recruited through written examinations and recommendation. The first civil service examination system was established by Emperor Wen of Sui . Emperor Yang of Sui established a new category of recommended candidates for the mandarinate in AD 605. The following Tang dynasty (618–907) adopted the same measures for drafting officials, and decreasingly relied on aristocratic recommendations and more and more on promotion based on the results of written examinations. The structure of the examination system was extensively expanded during the reign of Wu Zetian . [6] The system reached its apogee during the Song dynasty. [7]
In theory, the Chinese civil service system provided one of the main avenues for social mobility in Chinese society, although in practice, due to the time-consuming nature of the study, the examination was generally only taken by sons of the landed gentry. [8] The examination tested the candidate's memorization of the Nine Classics of Confucianism and his ability to compose poetry using fixed and traditional forms and calligraphy . It was ideally suited to literary candidates. Thus, toward the end of the Ming Dynasty, the system attracted the candidature of Tang Xianzu (1550-1616). Tang at 14 passed the imperial examination at the county level; and at 21, he did so at the provincial level; but not until he was 34 did he pass at the national level. However, he had already become a well-known poet at age 12, and among other things he went on to such distinction as a profound literati and dramatist that it would not be far-fetched to regard him as China's answer to William Shakespeare: Wang Rongpei and Zhang Ling (eds), The Complete Works of Tang Xianzu (2018). In the late 19th century, however, the system increasingly engendered internal dissatisfaction, and was criticized as not reflecting candidates' ability to govern well, and for giving undue weight to style over content and originality of thought. Indeed, long before its abandonment, the notion of the imperial system as a route to social mobility was somewhat mythical. In Tang's magnum opus, The Peony Pavilion, sc 13, Leaving Home, the male lead, Liu Mengmei, laments: ""After twenty years of studies, I still have no hope of getting into office"", and on this point Tang may be speaking through Liu as his alter ego. The system was finally abolished by the Qing government in 1905 as part of the New Policies reform package.
The Chinese system was often admired by European commentators from the 16th century onward. [9] However, the Chinese imperial examination system was hardly universally admired by all Europeans who knew of it. In a debate in the unelected chamber of the UK parliament on March 13, 1854, John Browne 'pointed out [clearly with some disdain ] that the only precedent for appointing civil servants by literary exams was that of the Chinese government': Coolican (2018), ch.5: The Northcote-Trevelyan Report, pp106–107.
In the 18th century, in response to economic changes and the growth of the British Empire , the bureaucracy of institutions such as the Office of Works and the Navy Board greatly expanded. Each had its own system, but in general, staff were appointed through patronage or outright purchase. By the 19th century, it became increasingly clear that these arrangements were falling short. ""The origins of the British civil service are better known. During the eighteenth century a number of Englishmen wrote in praise of the Chinese examination system, some of them going so far as to urge the adoption for England of something similar. The first concrete step in this direction was taken by the British East India Company in 1806."" [10] In that year, the Honourable East India Company established a college, the East India Company College , near London to train and examine administrators of the company's territories in India. [11] ""The proposal for establishing this college came, significantly, from members of the East India Company's trading post in Canton, China."" [10] Examinations for the Indian ""civil service""—a term coined by the Company—were introduced in 1829. [12]
British efforts at reform were influenced by the imperial examinations system and meritocratic system of China. Thomas Taylor Meadows, Britain's consul in Guangzhou , China argued in his Desultory Notes on the Government and People of China , published in 1847, that ""the long duration of the Chinese empire is solely and altogether owing to the good government which consists in the advancement of men of talent and merit only,"" and that the British must reform their civil service by making the institution meritocratic. [10] On the other hand, John Browne, in the 1854 debate mentioned above, 'argued that elegant writing had become an end in itself, and the stultifying effect of this on the Chinese civil service had contributed in no small measure to China's failure to develop its early lead over Western civilisations': Coolican, p107.
In 1853 the Chancellor of the Exchequer William Gladstone , commissioned Sir Stafford Northcote and Charles Trevelyan to look into the operation and organisation of the Civil Service. Influenced by the Chinese imperial examinations, the Northcote–Trevelyan Report of 1854 made four principal recommendations: that recruitment should be on the basis of merit determined through competitive examination, that candidates should have a solid general education to enable inter-departmental transfers, that recruits should be graded into a hierarchy and that promotion should be through achievement, rather than ""preferment, patronage or purchase"". It also recommended a clear division between staff responsible for routine (""mechanical"") work, and those engaged in policy formulation and implementation in an ""administrative"" class. [13]
The report was well-timed, because bureaucratic chaos during the Crimean War was causing a clamour for the change. The report's conclusions were immediately implemented, and a permanent, unified and politically neutral civil service was introduced as Her Majesty's Civil Service . A Civil Service Commission was also set up in 1855 to oversee open recruitment and end patronage, and most of the other Northcote–Trevelyan recommendations were implemented over some years. [14] Or so one version of the story goes.
There are, however, more nuanced ways to tell the tale.
Despite [civil servants'] many similarities, there also exists a great divide between the very small number of top mandarins and the very great number of more junior staff. ... the conventional wisdom is that this divide was the work of Sir Stafford Northcote and Sir Charles Trevelyan, but once you start poking around in the archives the story turns out to be rather more complicated. ... What is surprising is that, as originally drafted, the report contained only the most meagre proposals for establishing entry to the civil service via a competitive literary exam - one for intellectuals and one for mechanicals. There was such a proposal but it did not extend to departments subordinate to the Treasury. ... Gladstone warmly supported other aspects of the report but criticised its limited attack on patronage. ... He wanted the principle of competition 'sanctioned in its full breadth', and applied to the Treasury 'with unsparing vigour' [and] when the amended report was published nearly a year later it proposed to apply the competitive principle to all departments. ... Early in 1854, [Prime Minister] Russell wrote to Gladstone to say he hoped Gladstone was 'not thinking seriously of the plan of throwing open to competition the whole civil service of this country'. ... The departmental heads, in their response to the report, also criticised the thinking underlying the proposals for change... the Northcote-Trevelyan report was dead in the water. ... In the face of opposition from top civil servants, and a distinct lack of enthusiasm on the part of most ministers - particularly the Prime Minister - Gladstone was not inclined to push the matter too hard. The idea of a central competitive exam was dropped, along with most of the other proposals. Only one other proposal was put into effect; in 1854... the Cabinet agreed to the creation of a central examining board. A year later the Civil Service Commission was established ...— Coolican, op. cit., pp 4, 95, 96, 105, 110, 112
The same model, the Imperial Civil Service , was implemented in British India from 1858, after the demise of the East India Company 's rule in India through the Indian Rebellion of 1857 which came close to toppling British rule in the country. [15]
The Northcote–Trevelyan model remained essentially stable for a hundred years. This was a tribute to its success in removing corruption, delivering public services (even under the stress of two world wars), and responding effectively to political change. It also had a great international influence and was adapted by members of the Commonwealth . The Pendleton Civil Service Reform Act established a modern civil service in the United States, and by the turn of the 20th century almost all Western governments had implemented similar reforms.",source_text/9a5ed97aba3c93be54ba201cdfb380f1f023435a59e4adf9e77441ff0e98fc34-perplexity_1_0.txt,,no_support,True,song - sang - wrote - sings - movie - played - plays - blood - released - original,StanfordCitation,0.48,0.44999999999999996,0.46,0.41,[0.9720906615257263],[0.9720906615257263]

You might think a blockbuster franchise about cars would be pretty straightforward, but since it began in 2001 with the loud and brash street-racing and gangster thriller The Fast and Furious, the franchise has only got bigger in size, ambition and outrageousness – and the complicated narrative the 12 films have woven together can be difficult to follow.
With the two-part finale to the Fast saga wrapping up the story for Dominic Toretto (Vin Diesel) and his crew, the stakes are bound to be high.
So, ahead of Fast X, which will see the Toretto family tree branching out further, with Hollywood icon Rita Moreno joining the cast as Dom's grandmother, read on for everything you need to know about how watch the franchise in order.
Although most of the Fast films follow on from each other, there is one standout exception: you guessed it, The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift.
Although it was the third Fast film to be released in cinemas, Tokyo Drift is actually set between Fast & Furious 6 and Furious 7. Swerving away from the story of Brian and Dom, the film follows a completely new set of characters led by Sean Boswell (Lucas Black), a student forced to move to Japan to avoid jail time.
Here are the movies in chronological order :
- The Fast and the Furious (2001)
- 2 Fast 2 Furious (2003)
- Fast & Furious (2009)
- Fast Five (2011)
- Fast & Furious 6 (2013)
- The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift (2006)
- Furious 7 (2015)
- The Fate of the Furious (2017)
- Fast & Furious Presents: Hobbs & Shaw (2019)
- F9 (2021)
- Fast and Furious 10 (2023)
Tokyo Drift also marks the first appearance of Han Lue, a fan favourite who (SPOILER ALERT) appeared to be killed in a chase near the end of the film.
Fortunately, Universal decided Han was so popular he would be resurrected with a clever workaround: all subsequent Fast films would be set before Toyko Drift.
This meant Han was able to return alive and well in Fast & Furious, the next film in the franchise.
Just to make things even more complicated, the Fast and Furious franchise also features several high-speed prequels, sequels and midquels. Most of these shorts were created for DVD releases of the original movies, shining light on unknown areas of the high-speed saga’s timeline.
First released on the DVD of 2 Fast 2 Furious (the next film on this list), the short film Turbo-Charged Prelude shows exactly how Brian (Paul Walker) went from being an LAPD cop to criminal. The reason is the one you’d expect: after assisting Dom Toretto (Vin Diesel) evade law enforcement, Brian himself becomes a wanted man.
Los Bandoleros, the next short film, focuses on Dom and was served up to fans via a DVD bonus feature. No, it doesn’t explain how Brian became a fully-fledged FBI agent by the next film but does introduce audiences to Han (Sung Kang), Rico (Don Omar) and Tego (Tego Calderon). Including all of these mini-movies, the Fast and Furious timeline looks like this:
- The Fast and the Furious
- Turbo-Charged Prelude
- 2 Fast 2 Furious
- Los Bandoleros
- Fast & Furious
- Fast Five
- Fast & Furious 6
- The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift
- Furious 7
- The Fate of the Furious
- Fast & Furious Presents: Hobbs & Shaw
- F9
If you’re new to the Fast and Furious, sticking to the simplest route may be the best. After all, most of the movies follow a chronological order, with only really the third instalment in the franchise, The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift (2006), causing some confusing pile-ups in the timeline as discussed.
Here's how you watch Fast & Furious movies in order of release:
- The Fast and the Furious (2001)
- 2 Fast 2 Furious (2003)
- The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift (2006)
- Fast & Furious (2009)
- Fast Five (2011)

If you were intentionally designing a development to spark a NIMBY backlash, you might come up with something that looks a lot like the Clay Apartments. * A brand new building located in Seattle’s rapidly developing Capitol Hill neighborhood, it adheres to a modern aesthetic of poured concrete, muted tones, and floor-to-ceiling windows. True to form, the website for the Clay Apartments celebrates amenities such as a rooftop deck and stainless steel appliances. Hosting 76 “micro units,” the project seems perfectly optimized to house the well-paid, single young professionals that companies such as Amazon have attracted to the city in droves.
Today, however, the Clay Apartments house Seattlites earning roughly a third of the median income, most of whom have recently struggled with homelessness. As reported in Next City , thanks to a deal struck by a local affordable housing non-profit, those suffering the brunt of Seattle’s housing shortage—a crisis that leaves nearly 12,000 Seatellites homeless—now enjoy a safe place to call home.
Although the Clay Apartments project is exceptional in many ways, it’s far from the only development to blur the line between luxury and affordable housing: These aren’t stable, or standardized, concepts. Nevertheless, carping about “luxury development”—or more accurately, any market-rate development—has emerged as the preferred angle for opposing housing construction. In the recent past, the typical NIMBY complaint was that new housing was too affordable, and thus a threat to “community character,” a term loaded with racial baggage. Today’s NIMBYism, savvy to a changing political landscape, makes hay opposing new housing on the basis that it isn’t affordable enough.
Advanced by an unholy alliance of cynical property owners and misinformed activists , the argument goes like this: If local governments were to remove the arbitrary zoning barriers that are behind America’s housing shortage, developers would build only luxury apartments and condos. Such housing would be leased or sold at price points well beyond what regular working families can afford. At best, these units would sit empty as “ safety deposit boxes in the sky ,” doing nothing to ease the affordability crisis. At worst, all this new luxury could trigger higher housing costs, as developers rush in to demolish older affordable units and throw up residential towers.
This story has captured the minds of many local policy makers. But it’s nonsense. For all the NIMBY pearl-clutching over the construction of luxury apartments and condos, American cities aren’t building enough of them.
A t the risk of stating the obvious, luxury is just a marketing term. Much of what is eagerly cast today as “luxurious” is run-of-the-mill new or refurbished housing. Developers and real-estate brokers are not in the modesty business—they’re in the business of building, leasing, and selling homes, which depends on a flair for hyperbole. No recently built apartment or condo is merely “new” or “nice.” It’s luxury housing. Thus, a pleasant if unremarkable student apartment building in my neighborhood near UCLA might promise prospective residents “a life of luxury and endless comforts.”

The distinction between marketing and reality is crucial. Take Promenade Pointe in Norfolk, Virginia, an apartment building derided by neighbors as unwanted luxury housing. Yes, the building’s website promises “premiere luxury” including de rigueur granite countertops and stainless-steel appliances. But truthfully it’s a rather humdrum suburban apartment building, leasing at rates affordable to many Norfolk families. A successful attempt to block Promenade Pointe would have left a lot of regular people without a home.
Similarly, the recent surge in small-scale condo development in North Brooklyn has spurred intense concern about new development changing the grungy character of America’s “hipster paradise.” As demand for housing surges, developers have indeed found clever ways to build more units on underutilized lots. And these new condos are no one’s idea of affordable housing—prices for a studio hover at just over $500,000. Anyone grumbling about the North Brooklyn that was, however, has to grapple with the fact that these new condos are a fraction of the cost of nearby existing townhouses, which start at about $2 million. When a Brooklyn brownstoner complains about all the “luxury” condo development under way, she is usually criticizing homes far more affordable than her own.
For all the preoccupation with luxury, new apartments and condos are nearly always cheaper than existing single-family homes. As my UCLA colleague Shane Phillips points out, in every housing market in North America, a typical condo will cost a quarter to half as much as a single-family home. While a ramshackle bungalow in an expensive city such as Los Angeles might look cheaper than the shimmering new high-rise down the street, the reality is that a condo in that building will cost much less than the low-slung house. This is why density exists in the first place: Where land costs are high, building up allows us to spread these costs across more units, enabling more families to afford a home in their preferred neighborhood.
New multifamily development is not only more accessible than the typical single-family home; it may also help ease escalating housing prices. For decades, urban economists have argued that the affordable-housing crisis is a straightforward matter of demand outstripping supply: A lot of people want to live in certain neighborhoods, yet we don’t build enough housing to accommodate all of them. As a result, many households are forced to bid up the price of a fixed housing supply, until you get shacks in San Francisco selling for millions. From this angle, the need to build more housing—even luxury housing—is obvious. In a hot neighborhood, the young professionals are coming, for better or worse. Why not build giant “yuppie fish tanks” to absorb all that demand, sparing the existing housing supply?
A flurry of studies over the past few years have consistently found that new market-rate development, even of the luxury variety, helps relieve pressure on local housing prices in this way. According to one 2019 study of low-income census tracts, the construction of new market-rate rentals resulted in rents for nearby buildings falling by 5 to 7 percent. A more recent 2021 study , by the economist Kate Pennington, looking exclusively at San Francisco, found a more modest drop of 2 percent, alongside evidence that new development reduces the displacement and eviction of existing residents. It might not change minds at a raucous public hearing, but the research is clear: Even new high-end development can help cool local housing prices.
Luxury housing also has a curious way of turning into affordable housing through a phenomenon known as “ filtering .” As buildings age, designs fall out of fashion and affluent residents move into newer homes, allowing prices to decline. If you rent an apartment built more than 50 years ago, you may well be living in yesteryear’s luxury. Take the Metropolitan in D.C.’s Eckington neighborhood: Built in a lavish Art Deco style in the late 1930s, it was once the height of luxury; today, even after careful restoration, it commands rents close to the metropolitan average. The luxury housing built today will follow a similar path to affordability, if we let it.
This filtering effect can happen overnight. In the case of the Clay Apartments, a nonprofit was able to snap up a luxury building before leases were signed. At about $240,000 a unit, that housing didn’t come cheap. But with new affordable housing in Seattle costing roughly $300,000 a unit to build, in many cases it’s cheaper for affordable-housing agencies to simply buy up and convert existing market-rate units into income-restricted housing. Down the coast, in San Francisco—where each new unit of affordable housing runs about $750,000—letting luxury development rip while buying up and restricting some of it to low-income residents might be the only scalable way to produce affordable housing.
Even without the fancy financial footwork of a project such as the Clay Apartments, we don’t have to wait a century for luxury housing to add to the affordable supply. In a 2019 study , the economist Evan Mast found that even pricey development in wealthy neighborhoods sparks a chain reaction that extends all the way to the bottom of the housing market, as richer residents vacate older units for newer ones. The data suggest that for every 100 market-rate units built, as many as 48 moderate-income households can move into nicer housing. If this more subtle form of filtering is as robust as these findings indicate, luxury housing may quietly be generating a lot of affordable housing as soon as the first residents move in.
None of this is to say that high housing prices aren’t a problem—far from it. But any given luxury development is a symptom of—and in a small way, part of the cure for—a broader set of issues. As the urbanist writer Daniel Herriges suggests , what makes new housing expensive is not so much the amenities that brokers like to gush about, but the lack of supply in certain locations. In a context of extreme scarcity, the price of anything that gets built in a fashionable neighborhood such as New York’s SoHo or L.A.’s Venice will be exorbitant. The solution is not to stop developments with granite countertops, but to build many more like them, particularly in affluent areas.
Better yet, local policy makers could simply stop driving up the price on new housing with ill-considered zoning codes. Minimum parking requirements, for instance, which condition the construction of new housing on the provision of off-street parking spaces, can easily add $50,000 to the cost of each new condo, regardless of whether the prospective residents want or need parking. Rules of this nature abound in zoning codes, including mandates requiring large homes and prohibitions on the construction of inherently affordable duplexes and fourplexes.
Houston, a city that has attracted nearly 500,000 new residents over the past 20 years, reveals what easing land-use rules might actually look like: Back in 1998, facing early warning signs of an impending housing crunch, city planners dropped the minimum lot size needed to build a home from 5,000 to 1,400 square feet, such that developers could turn any given ranch-style home into three townhouses. As a result, more than 25,000 new townhouses were built in neighborhoods with easy access to transit and jobs, helping keep Houston one of the most affordable cities in America. Many of the new townhomes are quite nice. Some even flaunt granite countertops and stainless-steel appliances. But the best-kept secret about luxury is that, if you keep building it, eventually there’s enough for everyone.

The beginning of political science as an organized discipline in the United States can be dated to December 30, 1903.","The beginning of political science as an organized discipline in the United States can be dated to December 30, 1903.","The beginning of American political science as an organized discipline can be dated to December 30, 1903, when John Burgess, Frank Goodnow, Westel W. Willoughby, and others founded the American Political Science Association (APSA). The association's journal, the American Political Science Review ( APSR ), followed in 1906. Even though most schools still lacked separate political science departments, the appearance of the APSA, and thereafter its journal, legitimated professional commitment to political science as a coherent area of study. The APSA gave political scientists, in and out of the university, a sense of common purpose, and the APSR offered an outlet for original research and scholarly exposure.
As the discipline was established, political scientists increasingly incorporated political knowledge as their peculiar domain. Political scientists, after ""authorizing"" themselves through the creation of a discipline, began cordoning off political research as their area of study. The study of politics started to become a professional pursuit, sanctioned by a professional association. This trend toward professionalism in the field of political research became more clear during the behavioral revolution's move to ""pure"" science. With behavioralism, the discipline settled on a scientific identity, an identity that has changed little since its inception. Behavioralism, though, has its roots in the ""science of politics movement,"" which began in the 1920s.
Political scientists believed that a scientific, disciplinary, and professional identity (that is, acceptance as ""legitimate"" producers of knowledge) depended on a common and useful methodology to separate trained ""political scientists"" from methodologically untrained amateurs. Scientific method would allow political scientists to arrive at objective, value-free truth (or truths) about a certain aspect of (usually) American politics in order to aid a modernizing polity in a purely technical way. There could be no normative goals in a value-free science. Political scientists, in other words, should not seek to express what ought to be done. Instead, their goal must be simply to explain the political world.
In the early 1900s, Arthur F. Bentley offered a tool for empirical, value-free social research in his work, The Process of Government: A Study of Social Pressures. Although Bentley was not an academic by trade, he did influence subsequent generations of political scientists, especially those within the behavioralist tradition. In The Process of Government, Bentley wanted to move away from the traditional notions of scientific explanation in society. He considered political science, with its nineteenth-century reliance on formalist studies of institutions, to be dead. The ""barren formalism"" of political science needed to be touched up with the ""glow of humanity"" by studying social actors themselves ""for what they are"" and ""for what they represent"" (Bentley, pp. 163–164). According to Bentley, the ""raw material"" for the scientific study of government cannot be found in one person. It must always be located in ""something doing,"" in the activity of groups, in ""the dispersal of one grouping of forces by another grouping."" And while these groups do consist of thinking and feeling persons, the social scientist knows ""nothing of 'ideas' and 'feelings' except through the medium of actions"" (p. 175–176). Government is a process that is forever in flux, and, as such, it can never be described by law books, law, essays, addresses, or constitutional conventions.
Bentley argued that social science, then, should be empirical, measurable, progressive, and concerned with the interaction and activity of a complex and overlapping system of social, political, and economic groupings. Such a social science could, in Bentley's view, be objective and, as such, achieve ""knowledge."" Most of these aspects are evident again, in the science of politics movement of the 1920s and 1930s and in the behavioral political science that conquered the discipline by the late 1950s. The empirical, measurable, ""progressive,"" and quantified behavioralist tradition gave political science the ""scientific"" identity it had sought since Bentley's era.
The new era in political science that followed World War I, like most new eras in the discipline, repudiated the previous era of political science. Progressive political science was condemned as invalid and partisan, not scientific enough. The new era sought even more detached, scientific, methodical, and therapeutic reforms for what was perceived to be a democracy in crisis. According to post–World War I political scientists, the United States' ""liberal democracy"" emerged badly shaken from the war. Political scientists had supported the war ""for the usual reasons—it was supposed to end European autocracy and thus end war"" (Seidelman and Harpham, p. 102). Instead, emboldened and effective fascist and communist governments in Europe strengthened their abilities to motivate their populaces to act in accordance with government interests. Post–World War I political scientists in America noticed a peculiar lack of any such motivational ability in the United States, and their wrath fell on their immediate predecessors. In their view, reform-minded progressive political scientists had not adequately and systematically located receptive reform publics, and their superficial and hasty analyses and proposals had consequently failed to be effective.
In light of this, political scientists of the new era saw the need for scholarly renovation. They renewed their dedication to establishing scientific inquiry in the hope that ""scientific knowledge would emerge and contribute to improving the quality of public life in America"" (Ricci, p. 77). The professional identity of the political scientist became that of political ""healer,"" and political knowledge, implemented in the governmental system, was to be constructed toward this end. Political scientists such as Charles E. Merriam and Harold D. Lasswell saw themselves as social engineers whose purpose was the ""rational"" supervision of political actors tasked with ordering and controlling a logical and brave new political society. Merriam and Lasswell simply wanted to install a professional identity for political scientists based on a science that was organized to aid the liberal democratic state. As such, political knowledge was to be organized for the same purpose. This is part of the reason why such a formulation of science caught on in the discipline. It was constructed to correspond to the technical needs of society, and therefore it became the accepted identity for political scientists. But after World War II, this identity began to crumble. Behavioralists wanted to purify scientific political knowledge.
According to Albert Somit and Joseph Tanenhaus, numerous factors emerged to help establish behavioralism as a force in political science: Political scientists perceived that they were not considered legitimate scientists and consequently had problems securing research grants; they believed that the other social sciences (particularly psychology) were making broad advances while political science lagged behind; the reformist, normative nature of the discipline was generally considered speculative and unscientific; research technology (including survey techniques, statistical computations, and computers) became much more refined and available; and they pursued a ""pure"" science that operated on the presupposition that democracy is the best system of government because of its open and scientific qualities. In short, post–World War II political scientists sought to define the science of politics from the standpoint that science should be pure. The science of politics should be interested only in explaining the workings of American democracy in order to understand the American system better.
Postwar political scientists believed that political crises remained because pre–World War II political scientists had allowed their reformist aims to occlude their understanding of politics. Many postwar political scientists wanted to embark on the pure scientific project of analyzing the workings of the American system without tainting the analysis with speculative notions of reform. These were the first self-conscious attempts to push normative political theory to the margins of the discipline. The assumption that American democracy is the best political system in the world expels the normative determination of value from the discipline's activities. A pure science, after all, cannot consider such a claim. Rather, it must presuppose its end as it determines how best to reach or enhance it.
Somit and Tanenhaus have combined the various strands of behavioralism into what they term the ""behavioral creed"":
- Political science should search rigorously for regularities in political behavior in order to facilitate prediction and explanation.
- Political science should concern itself with empirical political phenomena, that is, with the behavior of individuals and political groups.
- Data should be quantifiable in order to aid predictive capabilities.
- Research should be theory driven; in other words, research should begin with a theory that yields empirically testable hypotheses.
- Political scientists should avoid applied (reform-minded) research in favor of pure scientific research.
- Values such as democracy, equality, and freedom cannot be scientifically established and should thus be avoided unless they can somehow be made empirically testable.
- Political science should become more interdisciplinary, at least at the behavioral level.
- Political science should place more emphasis on methodology and make better use of multivariate analysis, sample surveys, mathematical models, and simulation.
Behavioralists were intent on building a scientific community that was centered on behavioral inquiry. They could do this by further institutionalizing political knowledge. Therefore, the research skills that behavioral inquiry required served to exclude those who did not possess the proper training and to solidify the scientific identity of political scientists.
One example of behavioral inquiry can be found in the work of David B. Truman, who is probably best known for his book The Governmental Process, first published in 1951, which revived Bentley's group process theory of government. Truman's argument, although less polemical, closely resembles Bentley's and is offered in response to the expanding role of interest groups in American politics and the public's growing fear of their influence. The Governmental Process, by Truman's own account, contributed to the ""political behavior movement"" in political science by increasing ""the analytical strength and usefulness of the discipline"" (pp. xix–xx). It also triggered the growth of the study of interest groups in the United States and abroad. Like Bentley's work, The Governmental Process offers a tool for analysis: a theory to drive systematic behavioral research. It contains many ""testable hypotheses"" ranging from the political orientations of groups to the internal politics of the group process to the influence of groups on the legislature, the executive, the judiciary, and elections.
Truman's basic argument revolves around the notion that because every individual attempts to become an accepted participant in a group or a set of groups, it makes sense to study political behavior in terms of groups and group interactions. He argues that ""the patterns of action and attitude among individuals will differ from one another in large measure according to the clusters of group affiliations that the individuals have"" (p. 16). Individuals define themselves based on the opportunities that groups afford. In Truman's words, ""It appears … that the group experiences and affiliations of an individual are the primary, though not the exclusive, means by which the individual knows, interprets, and reacts to the society in which he [sic] exists"" (p. 21). Like Merriam, Truman believed that society had become sufficiently complex to necessitate an interdependent approach to the analysis of political behavior and government. In other words, any social or political action involves a complicated series of interactions, particularly at the group level, that affect individuals and the government. With this in mind, the purpose of Truman's book was to analyze rigorously both the operations of representative government in the United States and the character of groups' relationships with the governing process. He does not desire progressive reform; his research seeks ""pure"" explanation.
Another behavioralist, Heinz Eulau, openly criticized the reformist (""utopian"") political science of the pre–World War II era. In his 1969 book, Behavioralism in Political Science, Eulau argued that science can function only ""in an environment that permits freedom of inquiry and freedom of speech"" (p. 12). American liberal democracy allows such freedoms and thus is most suitable for scientific work. Political science can never undermine liberal democracy, as David M. Ricci reported that pre–World War II political scientists feared. Political scientists assumed, then, that American democracy must be alive and well as they pursued the new, nonreformist, scientific goal of analyzing and explaining the ways in which the American political system functioned.
The dominance of the behavioral approach to studying politics was seen in the field of international relations as well, which tended to personify states and study their ""behavior."" This approach has been seen most clearly in realist and neorealist research in international politics. The field of comparative politics was also affected by the behavioral shift, as its practitioners abandoned the field's legal-institutional approach in favor of a more quantitative analysis. Instead of simply explaining the similarities of and the differences between political institutions across culture and context, behaviorally inclined comparative politics scholars sought to ground such institutional differences and similarities in ""universal"" terms of political behavior. The field of normative political theory was largely immune to the behavioral revolution and operated as a critic from without, which ultimately served to marginalize it from the accepted approach of the discipline. Postbehavioralism altered this situation in some important ways. All of the various subfields of study were opened to other methodological approaches, and political theory moved in a bit from the margins. Still, the scientific mood was not fundamentally altered.
In 1967 the Caucus for a New Political Science was organized as a response to behavioral hegemony. Behavioral discourse, pro and con, dominated the discipline's mainstream by the mid-1960s in terms of method, language, and research focus. Members of the caucus lamented the limited scope of behavioral inquiry. Behavioralism, they argued, neglected too many possible points of view; it was too ""parochial."" The caucus desired a more open and expansive discipline. In 1969 David Easton responded to the aims of the caucus in his presidential address to the APSA. Easton coined the term postbehavioralism and made relevance and action its watchwords. Postbehavioralists, Easton argued, wanted to make political science more relevant to and active in society.
Ultimately, new areas of research were opened up within the discipline (for instance, the Vietnam War, race relations, poverty, and women's rights), and the well-populated, university-centered discipline became specialized. Political scientists increasingly carved up special areas of the discipline for themselves, each area with a special language and technique that made intercommunication difficult and often without purpose. These subfields rapidly grew into self-contained entities within the field of political science.
During this era of fragmentation, antibehavioral forces found new voices. Research that was distinctly anti-or nonbehavioral found legitimacy as the discipline's professional identity evolved away from its behavioral parochialism. The discipline became more tolerant of various perspectives on politics and political science during the postbehavioral era. The intellectual ""community"" that behavioralism constructed in the discipline of political science collapsed during the 1970s, the decade that witnessed the fragmentation of the discipline's research agenda. This transpired for at least three reasons: (1) the Caucus for a New Political Science's effectiveness at forcing the field to open up to more research interests; (2) the population explosion that occurred in the discipline following World War II, which increased the competition for recognition among political scientists; and (3) a related mood of openness that prevailed in the discipline following the closed and parochial behavioral era.
Because political scientists were generally required to publish in order to advance the accumulation of knowledge that ""scientific communities"" need, and because the range of suitable research topics was limited during the behavioral era while the population of the discipline was rapidly increasing, the discipline was quickly saturated. Political scientists sought new areas of expertise and the discipline opened up, allowing for the creation of many new subfields. The topics covered by these new subfields were so diverse by 1977 that Nelson Polsby, the managing editor of the APSR at the time, ""conceded that no editor could 'judge the quality of manuscripts over the full range of concerns that political scientists write about'"" (quoted in Ricci, pp. 222–223).
The discipline has become so complicated that even political scientists are unable to comprehend completely or become comfortable with its entire range of research. So much material is published in increasingly narrow fields that political scholars find it difficult to keep up with their own subfields, much less understand and integrate other subfields. Specialties and subspecialties continually emerge, and a broader base of expertise results. Each subfield churns out vast quantities of literature, and the literature from each subfield, taken together, is more than any one researcher can master. Nevertheless, one researcher can become an ""expert"" in the work of one subfield. Therefore, the discipline does not consist of ""experts"" in political knowledge (a central tenet of the APSA); it consists of ""experts"" in certain aspects of political knowledge. But while political scientists from different subfields find communication difficult, the notion of a common purpose (the construction of a body of political knowledge) remains.
In the early twenty-first century, however, the claim to this common purpose has come under some scrutiny by a new movement within the discipline called ""Perestroika."" The Perestroika movement, begun anonymously in 2000, calls attention to two problems in the discipline: its lack of inclusiveness and its increasingly mathematical approach. In many ways, this movement revives the thinking behind the Caucus for a New Political Science movement in its concern for the apparent irrelevance of the discipline in the wider political context and its criticism of an increasingly quantitative orientation within the discipline. Those active in the Perestroika movement consistently point to the growing preponderance of rational choice approaches to studying politics, which, in their view, are becoming hegemonic within the discipline as departments re-populate themselves with scholars using rational choice methodologies in their research. While the Perestroika movement has witnessed some success (such as the founding of a new journal that promises to be more methodologically inclusive), it is not at all clear that it will succeed in altering the increasingly quantitative orientation of the discipline.",source_text/bf3c425bb1c3f5a21a04ce88ed12f16b16c1d205b168c5fe31ccc0cbfb23a5f6-perplexity_1_0.txt,"The beginning of American political science as an organized discipline can be dated to December 30, 1903, when John Burgess, Frank Goodnow, Westel W.

SS Rajamouli’s RRR continues to be the talk of the town and recently, has been mesmerizing audiences in the US.
The film has been winning multiple accolades ahead of the Golden Globe Awards event as well as the Oscars nomination announcement.
Recently, SS Rajamouli was joined by Jr NTR in the US for an interview with the Hollywood Critics Association.
The interview went viral on social media with many praising Jr NTR for his language skills while there were several others who were left “cringing” at his “fake American accent”.
Check out the video below:
Reacting to the video, one user wrote, “He's clearly faking his accent”.
Another user wrote, “Why can't he speak in Indian accent? Akda settle ayi accent catch cheste it's fine kani chinna tour kosam inta showoff avasarledu. NTR should stop being fake everywhere he goes to grab attention. Just being himself should be enough. #RRRforOscars”.
A third user reacted, “You all like this accent? He speaks so nicely I love listening to him, love his sense of humour but this accent is so off putting. Wish someone would tell him to speak like he does originally”.
A fourth user commented, “Being genuine>>>>> Attention Grabbers Learn @tarak9999 Dont run after attention, make good movies You will grow automatically”.
Check out the reactions below:
However, there were others who defended their favourite star & his accent.
One fan wrote, “I don’t think he consciously changes his accent. He is a linguist so he unconsciously adapts the nuances of each language and his target audience and channels accordingly @tarak9999 #RRR #RRRForOscars”.
A second fan commented, “He may not actually be putting an accent. I think these people have studied in international schools with English teachers. Many even went to Europe for university. Chances are he naturally speaks like that, and swaps to an Indian accent in India. That's what adivi sesh does”.

A crime occurs when someone breaks the law by an overt act, omission, or neglect that can result in punishment. A person who has violated a law, or has breached a rule, is said to have committed a criminal offense .
In the U.S., three primary classifications of criminal offenses exist—felonies, misdemeanors, and infractions. Federal, state, and local government officials pass laws defining what constitutes a crime, so the definition of crime can vary from state to state and even city to city. In the U.S., police and sheriff's departments generally enforce the law and may arrest those accused of committing a crime, while the judicial system—comprised of judges and juries—generally imposes punishments or sentences for various crimes, as they are defined in given jurisdictions.
There are two main categories of crime : property crime and violent crime. There are other types outside of these, but many crimes can be placed into these two categories.
A property crime is committed when someone damages, destroys, or steals someone else's property. Stealing a car and vandalizing a building are examples of property crimes. Property crimes are by far the most commonly committed crime in the United States.
A violent crime occurs when someone harms, attempts to harm, threatens to harm, or conspires to harm someone else. Violent crimes involve force or threat of force and include crimes such as rape, robbery, and homicide. Some crimes can be both property crimes and violent crimes. Examples include carjacking someone's vehicle at gunpoint and robbing a convenience store with a handgun.
Some crimes are neither violent crimes nor property crimes. A crime of omission entails failing to obey the law, which can endanger people and property. Running a stop sign, for example, is a crime because it puts the public in danger. Withholding medication or neglecting someone who needs medical care or attention are also examples of crimes of omission. If you know someone who is abusing a child and you do not report it, you could be charged with a crime for failing to act.
The phrase ""white-collar crime"" was first used in 1939 by sociologist Edwin Sutherland during a speech to members of the American Sociological Society. Sutherland defined it as ""a crime committed by a person of respectability and high social status in the course of his occupation.""
Generally, white-collar crime is nonviolent and committed for financial gain by business professionals, politicians, and others in positions of relative power. Often, white-collar crimes include fraudulent financial schemes. Examples include securities fraud, insider trading, Ponzi schemes, embezzlement, money laundering, insurance fraud, tax fraud, and mortgage fraud.
Society decides what is and is not a crime through its system of laws. In the United States, there are three separate systems of laws: federal, state, and local.
Federal laws are passed by the U.S. Congress and applied to everyone in the United States. When federal laws conflict with state and local laws, federal laws generally prevail. Federal laws cover a range of areas including immigration, business, child welfare, Social Security, consumer protection, controlled substances, bankruptcy, education, housing, environmental protection and land use, and discrimination based on gender, age, race, or ability. The impeachment of government officials is often decided by federal laws as well.
State laws are passed by elected legislators—also known as lawmakers—and can vary widely from state to state. Gun laws, for example, are different across the country. Although drunk driving is illegal in all 50 states, the penalties for driving while intoxicated can be very different between states. Some areas covered by state laws include education, family issues (such as wills, inheritance, and divorce), criminal offenses, health and safety, public assistance, licensing and regulation, Medicaid, and property crimes.
Local laws, usually known as ordinances, are passed by local county or city governing bodies such as commissions or councils. Local ordinances usually control how residents are expected to behave in the community, such as slowing down in school zones and disposing of trash properly. Local laws often pertain to safety and property.
In the criminal justice system of the U.S., if you are arrested for a crime, you are detained and read your Miranda rights , which state that you have the right to an attorney, the right to remain silent, and that anything you say ""can and will"" be used against you in a court of law. You are then given an arraignment , where you make your first appearance in court. Under due process , your constitutional rights entitle you to:
- A trial by a jury of your peers
- A public trial
- A speedy trial
- The right to confront witnesses against you
- Protection from cruel and unusual punishment
- Protection from paying excessive bail
- Protection from being tried twice for the same crime, which is called double jeopardy
The criminal justice system is not a one-size-fits-all system; it is dependent on human beings. Because of this, biases exist, and different populations, such as Black men and other underserved populations, can and often are treated differently by the legal system.
One area of note about the criminal justice system is that usually someone has to have ""intent"" to be accused of a crime, meaning they intended to break the law, but this is not always the case. You can be charged with a crime even if you don't know the law exists. For example, you may not know that a city has passed an ordinance banning the use of cell phones while driving, but if you are caught doing it, you can be charged and punished.
The phrase ""ignorance of the law is no exception"" means that you can be held liable for breaking a law you didn't know existed.",source_text/62fb59f6c2a199204c4443dc960ddc4e910ec3d632a785ade1eaf7a5b5ca10bf-neeva_0_0.txt,"Society decides what is and is not a crime through its system of laws.

In the presence of antidiuretic hormone (ADH), or arginine vasopressin (AVP), the free water clearance will increase as ADH acts on the kidney to cause water reabsorption, leading to a decrease in urine output and an increase in urine osmolality. This can be seen as an increase in the free water clearance, as the kidneys are reabsorbing more water from the filtrate and the plasma volume is increasing.",Free water clearance (CH2O) is the volume of blood plasma that is cleared of solute-free water per unit time.,"From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia
In the physiology of the kidney , free water clearance ( C H 2 O ) is the volume of blood plasma that is cleared of solute -free water per unit time. An example of its use is in the determination of an individual's state of hydration. Conceptually, free water clearance should be thought of relative to the production of isoosmotic urine , which would be equal to the osmolarity of the plasma. If an individual is producing urine more dilute than the plasma, there is a positive value for free water clearance, meaning pure water is lost in the urine in addition to a theoretical isoosmotic filtrate. If the urine is more concentrated than the plasma, then free water is being extracted from the urine, giving a negative value for free water clearance. A negative value is typical for free water clearance, as the kidney usually produces concentrated urine except in the cases of volume overload by the individual.
At its simplest, the kidney produces urine composed of solute and pure (solute-free) water. How rapidly the kidney clears the blood plasma of a substance (be it water or solute) is the renal clearance , which is related to the rate of urine production. The rate at which plasma is cleared of solute is the osmolal clearance; the rate at which plasma is cleared of solute-free water is the free water clearance.
Since urine flow is determined by the rate at which plasma is cleared of solutes and water (as discussed above), urine flow (V) is given as the sum of osmolar ( C osm ) and free water clearance ( C H 2 O ):
Rearranging yields C H 2 O
Since osmolar clearance is given as the product of urine flow rate and the ratio of urine to plasma osmolality, this is commonly represented as
For example, for an individual with a urine osmolality of 140 mOsm/L, plasma osmolality of 280 mOsm/L, and a urine production of 4 ml/min, the free water clearance is 2 ml/min, obtained from
Free water clearance can be used as an indicator of how the body is regulating water. A free water clearance of zero means the kidney is producing urine isosmotic with respect to the plasma. Values greater than zero imply that the kidney is producing dilute urine through the excretion of solute-free water. Values less than zero imply that the kidney is conserving water (likely under the influence of antidiuretic hormone , ADH), resulting in the production of concentrated urine.",source_text/836b94071ce3ad5509feedb85a58c375a12760bfde40bdf3405ccc59857052da-you_0_0.txt,"In the physiology of the kidney, free water clearance (CH2O) is the volume of blood plasma that is cleared of solute-free water per unit time.",complete_support,False,song - sang - wrote - sings - movie - played - plays - blood - released - original,StanfordCitation,0.74,0.68,0.7,0.6,[0.9051910042762756],[0.9051910042762756]

Other laws and policies that can reduce access to alcohol and alcohol-impaired driving include zero tolerance laws, lower BAC limits, publicized sobriety checkpoints, and ignition interlocks for everyone convicted of drinking and driving. To avoid drinking and driving, people can choose not to drink and drive and help others do the same, and buckle up every time. Additionally, people can choose a non-drinking designated driver, eat plenty of food and drink water, and never get in a car with a driver who has been drinking.","To avoid drinking and driving, people can choose not to drink and drive and help others do the same, and buckle up every time.","85%

Four in 5 people who drink and drive are men.
US adults drank too much and got behind the wheel about 112 million times in 2010. Though episodes of driving after drinking too much (“drinking and driving”) have gone down by 30% during the past 5 years, it remains a serious problem in the US. Alcohol-impaired drivers* are involved in about 1 in 3 crash deaths, resulting in nearly 11,000 deaths in 2009.
Driving drunk is never OK. Choose not to drink and drive and help others do the same.
*These drivers had blood alcohol concentrations of at least 0.08%. This is the illegal blood alcohol concentration level for adult drivers in the United States.
Problem
- Every person in every seat should be buckled up on every trip. Seat belts reduce serious injuries and deaths from crashes by about 50%.
- Primary enforcement seat belt laws allow police to stop vehicles just because someone is not wearing a seat belt. These state laws are effective in increasing seat belt use.
Certain groups are more likely to drink and drive than others.
- Men were responsible for 4 in 5 episodes (81%) of drinking and driving in 2010.
- Young men ages 21-34 made up only 11% of the U.S. adult population in 2010, yet were responsible for 32% of all instances of drinking and driving.
- 85% of drinking and driving episodes were reported by people who also reported binge drinking. Binge drinking means 5 or more drinks for men or 4 or more drinks for women during a short period of time.
There are proven ways to prevent people from drinking and driving.
- At sobriety checkpoints, police stop drivers to judge if they are driving under the influence of alcohol. More widespread, frequent use of these checkpoints could save about 1,500 to 3,000 lives on the road each year.
- Minimum legal drinking age laws prohibit selling alcohol to people under age 21 in all 50 states and the District of Columbia. Keeping and enforcing 21 as the minimum legal drinking age helps keep young, inexperienced drivers from drinking and driving.
- Ignition interlocks prevent drivers who were convicted of alcohol-impaired driving from operating their vehicles if they have been drinking. Interlocks are effective in reducing re-arrest rates from drinking and driving by about two-thirds while the device is on the vehicle.

Heritage can be anything that a person, family, business or community values enough to protect it for the future.The sense of singular and communal identity it gives is invaluable.
An attractive historical environment can bring together consumers and businesses. Heritage can prove a potent factor in the attraction of new business as well as being a serious factor in maintaining existing businesses.
Our heritage comes not only from the aspect of our buildings, but also from the characters and events within the whole community. Recognising our heritage value allows us to develop our community.
A historical environment is, therefore, an important element in the generation of new businesses and community development. Links to our communal ancestry provides added interest for investors as well as an anchor to help maintain existing businesses.
Understanding the early development of villages and towns provides us with a sense of continuity. We live with the past all around us. The way we interact with our local buildings, parks, and streets, builds a distinct local culture. When we combine this with an understanding of our local history, we can recognise a sense of identity.
The adaptive reuse of buildings for both living and work spaces has a favourable effect in our neighbourhoods. Fresh thinking and different ideas help new initiatives. Education, regeneration, housing and economic growth all benefit from historical association. Therefore recognition of our local traditions is also beneficial for our communities.
“The real, the essential purpose, in this day, of our old buildings is to be instructive relics of the past art and past manners of life.” William Morris
- Heritage can provide the opportunity for members of the community whatever their age and academic background to learn new transferrable skill
- By bringing communities together to celebrate elements of their past.
- History projects embrace cross-generational working providing an opportunity for people with different life experiences to work together.
At Discovering Heritage we aim to enhance community heritage by researching the histories of lives, houses and businesses of not only celebrated local buildings and characters but also of lesser known historical aspects in our communities. We believe research of this nature is an important element in bringing together communities. Celebrating local history in this way helps to unite local businesses and consumers whilst attracting fresh investment and ideas to local areas. It can help regenerate and re establish our high streets and local amenities. Through research, we can build and identify with a colourful account of our local history.

Doctors may treat these cats with oxygen to enrich levels in the blood and restore free breathing. There are medications that are designed to dissolve heart blood clots in cats. These are known as thrombolytics and are used soon after diagnosis. Cats that do not respond to these medications may need surgery to remove the clot. Would you like more information on this topic?",Cats that do not respond to these medications may need surgery to remove the clot.,"The most common type of heart blood clot in cats is aortic thromboembolism. Aortic thromboembolisms are blood clots located within the cat's aorta. When the clot breaks loose and inhibits blood flow to other vessels and tissues in the body, symptoms occur.
Cats can develop heart conditions that lead to serious complications, such as the formation of blood clots. Blood clots that develop can break loose and travel to other parts of the body. Certain types of heart conditions associated with heart blood clots are hereditary or breed specific. In addition, male cats are more likely to have trouble with blood clots than females.
The symptoms associated with cardiac blood clots in cats can vary, depending on the cause of the condition. The following is a list of the most common symptoms reported in cats with this condition:
- Pain
- Vomiting
- Paralysis
- Trouble walking or changes in gait
- Hypothermia
- Shallow or labored breathing
- Bluish tint in foot pads or nails
- Weakness
- Shock
- Hind leg pain
- Fainting spells
There are several conditions that can cause heart blood clots in cats. Some include:
- Dilated cardiomyopathy
- Congestive heart failure
- Congenital defects of the heart at birth
- Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy
- Restrictive cardiomyopathy
Additionally, some factors can increase a cat’s risk of developing clots, such as breed and sex. Males, mixed breeds, and certain breeds such as Ragdoll and Birman, are more likely to be affected by the condition than other cats.
Veterinarians must gain information from the cat's owner to help them make a diagnosis. A medical history is taken before examination. Doctors must know if there were any problems at birth or pre-existing medical conditions and how long symptoms have been present. After taking a full and detailed medical history, doctors take vital signs to determine the cat’s overall stability. This includes heart rate, temperature, weight, and respiration rate. In addition, the doctor may take a urine sample to determine if any infection or abnormality is present. Blood tests are typically ordered, including a CBC, or complete blood count, and a chemical profile. High levels of glucose in the bloodstream is an indication the cat is under cardiac stress. Doctors also listen to the heart for unusual sounds.
Doctors also use a variety of diagnostic tests to help them diagnose blood clots and heart conditions. X-rays of the chest often show an enlargement of the heart associated with these conditions. If an aortic thromboembolism is suspected, an ultrasound of the abdomen may be used to confirm it.
The treatment for cats with blood clots in the heart depends on the cause of the condition. Cats diagnosed with aortic thromboembolism are typically admitted to the hospital. This is because cats with this condition are at an increased risk of going into heart failure suddenly and dying. Doctors may treat these cats with oxygen to enrich levels in the blood and restore free breathing. There are medications that are designed to dissolve heart blood clots in cats. These are known as thrombolytics and are used soon after diagnosis. Cats that do not respond to these medications may need surgery to remove the clot. Doctors admit these cats into the hospital following surgery to administer pain medications and continue monitoring.

The technique of detection of the antigen-antibody complex is based on the in vitro type of antigen-antibody interaction.","It is a very sensitive in vitro assay, capable of detecting as low as a few picograms of analyte in the experimental tube when using antibodies of high affinity.","From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia
|Radioimmunoassay|
|MeSH||D011863|
A radioimmunoassay ( RIA ) is an immunoassay that uses radiolabeled molecules in a stepwise formation of immune complexes . A RIA is a very sensitive in vitro assay technique used to measure concentrations of substances, usually measuring antigen concentrations (for example, hormone levels in blood ) by use of antibodies .
Although the RIA technique is extremely sensitive and extremely specific , requiring specialized equipment, it remains among the least expensive methods to perform such measurements. It requires special precautions and licensing, since radioactive substances are used. [ citation needed ]
In contrast, an immunoradiometric assay (IRMA) is an immunoassay that uses radiolabeled molecules but in an immediate rather than stepwise way.
A radioallergosorbent test (RAST) is an example of radioimmunoassay. It is used to detect the causative allergen for an allergy .
Classically, to perform a radioimmunoassay, a known quantity of an antigen is made radioactive , frequently by labeling it with gamma-radioactive isotopes of iodine , such as 125-I , or tritium [1] attached to tyrosine . This radiolabeled antigen is then mixed with a known amount of antibody for that antigen, and as a result, the two specifically bind to one another. Then, a sample of serum from a patient containing an unknown quantity of that same antigen is added. This causes the unlabeled (or ""cold"") antigen from the serum to compete with the radiolabeled antigen (""hot"") for antibody binding sites. As the concentration of ""cold"" antigen is increased, more of it binds to the antibody, displacing the radiolabeled variant, and reducing the ratio of antibody-bound radiolabeled antigen to free radiolabeled antigen. The bound antigens are then separated and the radioactivity of the free(unbound) antigen remaining in the supernatant is measured using a gamma counter . This value is then compared to a standardised calibration to curve to work out the concentration of the unlabelled antigen in the patient serum sample. [2] RIAs can detect a few picograms of analyte in an experimental tubes if using antibodies of high affinity. [1]
This method can be used for any biological molecule in principle and is not restricted to serum antigens, nor is it required to use the indirect method of measuring the free antigen instead of directly measuring the captured antigen. For example, if it is undesirable or not possible to radiolabel the antigen or target molecule of interest, a RIA can be done if two different antibodies that recognize the target are available and the target is large enough (e.g., a protein) to present multiple epitopes to the antibodies. One antibody would be radiolabeled as above while the other would remain unmodified. The RIA would begin with the ""cold"" unlabeled antibody being allowed to interact and bind to the target molecule in solution. Preferably, this unlabeled antibody is immobilized in some way, such as coupled to an agarose bead, coated to a surface, etc. Next, the ""hot"" radiolabeled antibody is allowed to interact with the first antibody-target molecule complex. After extensive washing, the direct amount of radioactive antibody bound is measured and the amount of target molecule quantified by comparing it to a reference amount assayed at the same time. This method is similar in principle to the non-radioactive sandwich ELISA method. [3]
This method was developed by Solomon Berson and Rosalyn Sussman Yalow at the Veterans Administration Hospital in the Bronx , New York. [4] [5] This revolutionary development earned Dr. Yalow the Nobel Prize for Medicine in 1977, the second woman ever to win it. [6] In her acceptance speech, Dr. Yalow said, ""The world cannot afford the loss of the talents of half its people if we are to solve the many problems which beset us."" [7] Yalow shared the Nobel Prize with Roger Guillemin , and Andrew Schally who earned the prize based on their research into ""the peptide hormone production of the brain"".

Vertical lines on fingernails may indicate certain health issues stemming from compromised adrenal glands. Ridges in the fingernails could also be a sign of an underlying condition, especially if the ridges are horizontal. Some systemic diseases that may cause nail plate grooves to develop include rheumatic fever, malaria, pemphigus, Raynaud disease, and myocardial infarction. Nutrient deficiencies and stress can also cause ridges in the nails. It is best to consult with a healthcare professional for proper diagnosis and treatment.","Ridges in the fingernails could also be a sign of an underlying condition, especially if the ridges are horizontal.","- Damage from using artificial or acrylic nails or getting gel manicures for long periods.
- Injury to your nail, like slamming your finger in a door or dropping something on your foot.
- Severe illness with high fever, such as COVID-19 , measles or pneumonia .
Certain nutritional deficiencies can cause changes to your nails. Zinc deficiency can cause Beau’s lines and white spots on your nails. Iron deficiency can cause vertical nail ridges and koilonychia (spoon nails) . Spoon nails have a depression in the middle, like the center of your nail was scooped out. You may be able to hold a drop of water on your nail.
First, see a healthcare provider to find out the underlying cause. Treating the cause can usually improve the look of your nails and allow healthy nails to grow in.
For instance, medication for thyroid disease often improves or resolves related nail problems. Taking iron or zinc supplements — with your provider’s guidance — may help if you have a deficiency. However, it takes several months for your nails to grow out and it takes time to see a change in your nails.
If you have Beau’s lines from a previous illness, the lines should gradually grow out. But if you keep getting new Beau’s lines, tell your provider. Repeated Beau’s lines could be a sign that you have a condition that keeps interrupting your nail growth.
If your provider has ruled out any health conditions, you can treat nail ridges with home care. The ridges may not go away completely, but you can improve the appearance of your nails if you:
- Apply moisturizer to your nails and cuticles daily to relieve dry skin or eczema. At bedtime, apply a skin cream to your hands and put on thin cotton gloves for sleeping. You can also apply a cream to your feet and wear cotton socks. If you have diabetes or neuropathy , talk to your healthcare provider about foot care.
- Ask your provider about taking biotin supplements, which could help with nail growth.
- Don’t bite your fingernails or cut your cuticles.
- Take breaks from getting gel manicures or using artificial nails or acrylics. Using these treatments continually can weaken your nails or dry them out.
- Trim your fingernails with a curved shape and your toenails straight across.
- Use a nail buffer to gently smooth the surface of your nails.
- Wear gloves that protect your hands when working with chemicals like household cleaners.
There’s no guaranteed way to prevent nail ridges. But seeing your provider as recommended can help. Tell your provider about any health changes, including changes to your nails. If you develop nail ridges, your provider can work with you to treat the underlying cause.
Always tell your provider if you notice new ridges or lines in your nails. You may not need treatment, but you won’t know until you find out what’s causing the ridges. Other nail changes to mention to a healthcare provider include:
- Changes to the shape of your nails, including nail clubbing or spoon-shaped nails.
- Color changes in your nails, including white, green, yellow or dark marks.
- Dents (nail pitting).
- Redness and swelling around one or more of your nails.
A note from Cleveland Clinic
Your nails provide important information about your health. If you have nail ridges, don’t ignore them. Talk to your provider so you can find out the cause and how to treat it, if necessary. With time and treatment, you may see new, smoother nails grow in. And if your nail ridges aren’t due to a health condition or deficiency, home nail care may help.",source_text/de73105ee0f0688b371e9e705538ea66671ba64554f131ce46be7a94f49b7017-perplexity_1_0.txt,Ridges in your nails can be a sign of a health condition or a previous injury to your nail.,partial_support,True,ridges - fingernails - horizontal - bottles - nail - tinted - vertical - deficiencies - pills - parallel,StanfordCitation,0.5,0.49,0.49,0.48,[0.5895307660102844],[0.5895307660102844]

Other parts of the world use boilers and pipes to heat buildings instead.",Other parts of the world use boilers and pipes to heat buildings instead.,"From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia
The New York City steam systems include Con Edison's Steam Operations and other smaller systems that provide steam to New York University and Columbia University . Many individual buildings in New York have their own steam systems.
Con Edison's Steam Operations is a district heating system which carries steam from generating stations under the streets to heat and cool buildings and businesses in Manhattan . Some New York businesses and facilities also use steam for cleaning and disinfection.
The New York Steam Company began providing service in lower Manhattan on March 3, 1882. [2] Today, Consolidated Edison operates the largest commercial steam system in the world (larger than the next nine combined). [3] The organization within Con Edison responsible for the system's operation, known as Steam Operations , provides steam service to over 1,700 commercial and residential customers in Manhattan from Battery Park to 96th Street uptown on the west side, and 89th Street on the east side of Manhattan. Roughly 27 billion pounds (12,000,000 t) of steam flow through the system every year. [4]
Steam provides heat and cooling to many buildings in New York. The steam system also provides humidity to art museums, steam cleaning for restaurants to clean dishes, and other uses. [3]
Approximately 30% of the ConEd steam system's installed capacity and 50% of the annual steam generated comes from cogeneration . [5] Cogeneration and Heat Recovery Steam Generation (HRSG) significantly increase the fuel efficiency of cogenerated electricity and thereby reduce the emission of pollutants , such as NOx , sulfur dioxide , carbon dioxide , and particulate matter, as well as the city's carbon footprint . Con Edison is promoting the use of steam for cooling in the summer months, something that can be accomplished with the installation of absorption chillers . [6] Such trigeneration systems reduce peak electrical loads and save construction costs associated with expanding electrical infrastructure.
Clouds of condensation are vented from manholes in Manhattan through orange and white ""chimneys"". This can be caused by external water being boiled by contact with the steam pipes or by leaks in the steam system itself. [1]
At least twelve steam pipe explosions have occurred in New York City since 1987. [7] The most recent major incident was the 2018 steam pipe explosion which occurred in the Flatiron District and forced the evacuation of 49 buildings. [8] [9] The explosion released concrete, asphalt, "" asbestos -containing material"" and mud into the air. The asbestos cleared out of the air to safe-level. [10] [11] A previous incident was the 2007 New York City steam explosion , and another on June 28, 1996, at a plant on East 75th Street.

Since I Found You is a 2018 Philippine drama television series starring Piolo Pascual , Arci Muñoz , JC de Vera , Alessandra de Rossi and Empoy . The series premiered on ABS-CBN 's Primetime Bida evening block and worldwide via The Filipino Channel from April 16 to August 10, 2018, replacing The Good Son . It was replaced by Halik . [1]
Nathan Capistrano (Piolo Pascual) is the 40-year-old CEO of Golden Builders, Inc. He is a straight shooter who goes after what he wants no matter the cost or the obstacles, and accepts no excuse from anybody – not even his loved ones.
This ruthless and uncompromising outlook comes from the fact that Nathan faced the hardships of life at an early age. He grew up poor, rising from poverty without anyone helping or supporting him. But despite his current wealth and success, he is quick to realize that it is lonely at the top – and it is frustrating.
This is when he meets Dani Cobarrubias (Arci Muñoz), a spunky and outspoken 20-something who Nathan eventually views as a kindred spirit. He allows himself to fall in love with her, and everything seems to be perfect between them.",source_text/8556136329443603c311a12cfa05664d2a1cd1810999838487f0fa541bc8d263-bing_chat_0_0.txt,"Since I Found You is a 2018 Philippine drama television series starring Piolo Pascual, Arci Muñoz, JC de Vera, Alessandra de Rossi and Empoy.",complete_support,False,greys - anatomy - killed - died - dies - daryl - mickey - governor - walking - jerry,StanfordCitation,0.67,0.5233333333333333,0.5,0.4,[0.05681155249476433],[0.05681155249476433]

You can find more information on these techniques by visiting the provided links. If you want to learn how to melt glass yourself, you can find a guide on wikiHow.","There are several techniques for melting glass, including pot melting, kiln casting, and fusing.","If you fuse glass, at some point you read about the pot melt or aperture pour technique. It is often talked about as a great way to use leftover pieces of glass or as a way to recycle a failed project. This technique has been on my “to-try” list for a long time.
The basic process involves suspending a clay pot with a hole, or multiple holes, in the bottom of it over a kiln shelf. The kiln is heated up to 1700 degrees F at which point the glass begins to flow out of the holes onto the kiln shelf creating, hopefully, a wonderful piece of swirled glass. At least that is the theory.
I read everything I could find in my books and on the internet about this technique and finally gave it a try. I was really quite nervous about it. For one thing, the last time I did a similar technique, a screen melt, it ruined my kiln shelf. My other concern was taking the kiln up to its maximum temperature of 1700 degrees F. I had visions of the clay pot exploding and ruining my kiln. The good news is that the pot did not explode, but the kiln shelf did take a bit of a beating. Here is a summary of what I did and what I would change the next time.
Pot
I used a clay pot from Germany. Numerous articles I read said to use pots from Germany, Italy, or the U.S. because the ones from Mexico tend to crack. I made the hole in the bottom larger by chiseling away at it with a screwdriver and hammer. Not elegant, but it worked. The pot did survive with no cracks.
Glass
I used approximately 46 ounces of glass which resulted in an 11.5” disk. Almost half of that was clear glass. The rest was made up of mostly equal parts of blue and white and a few pieces of yellow/green thrown in. I placed them standing up in the pot grouping the colors together and added a lot of clear on top. I should have taken a picture of the setup. I ended up with a brown center. Not sure what happened, but next time, I’d use less glass and not pile up the clear on top.
Kiln Shelf
I used an old kiln shelf with at least 20 coats of primer. Even with 20 coats, it roughed up parts of the shelf. I had to do a little sanding to get it smooth again. Next time I may try using a fiber paper on the shelf.
Firing Schedule
I went up to 1650 and held at that temperature for 90 minutes. That seemed like it was more than enough to empty the pot. Next time I will only go up to 1600 and try a 60 minute hold. Then I dropped the temperature to 1480 and held for 10 minutes to let everything even out. It was pretty flat, but next time I would hold for 15 minutes.
All in all, it turned out okay. With this technique, it is hard to predict what the outcome will be. Some glass colors can change at high temperatures and some will react with others. I am not really fond of the piece as a whole, but small sections of it incorporated into a larger piece will make a great piece.",source_text/acd2b14e0addb9d15bedef424fd8ef7f9ed26ed5a72b1c072633b95f588c3d18-perplexity_0_1.txt,"If you fuse glass, at some point you read about the pot melt or aperture pour technique.",partial_support,True,song - sang - wrote - sings - movie - played - plays - blood - released - original,StanfordCitation,0.46,0.46,0.46,0.46,[0.7413367033004761],[0.7413367033004761]

Cash value life insurance means the policy includes a savings component. It does double duty by providing a death benefit and building monetary value. This feature is only available with permanent life insurance.
Permanent life insurance lasts a lifetime and provides benefits while you are living and when you're gone. Keep reading to learn more, including the types of permanent life.
So, where does this cash value come from? Let's take a look at how a permanent life insurance policy builds cash value:
Zoe is 25 years old. She buys a cash value life insurance policy with a $1 million death benefit. Each month, she pays the premium amount due.
From that monthly amount, the life insurance company:
- Takes out a portion for its fees
- Allocates part of the amount to the policy's death benefit
- Puts the remainder toward the policy's cash value
- The cash value is then invested in the policy's savings component
- The cash value increases or decreases depending on the performance of the investment fund selected
- The cash value also earns interest over the years
At age 65, Zoe decides to retire. Her life insurance policy's cash value has grown to $750,000. She can withdraw some of the cash value or apply it to lower her premium payments.
Not all cash value life insurance policies build cash value the same way. Depending on the policy type, the savings component might be:
- A low risk, low interest savings account that offers a guaranteed cash value
- A fluctuating, but stable account based on current index fund rates or
- An investment account that mimics the performance of mutual funds, stocks, bonds, etc.
Think of cash value life insurance as an investment fund including within your life insurance policy.
Throughout Your Life
The cash value can be used in several ways depending on your needs. You can:
- Borrow against the cash value like a loan. There's no credit check, very low interest, and you're paying yourself back.
- Withdraw it and use the money for an emergency or other expenses. If the withdrawal amount is less than or equal to the cash value you paid in, your withdrawal is tax-free.
- Use the accumulated cash value to pay future premiums.
- Withdraw the cash value to supplement your retirement income.
- Increase the policy's death benefit amount if the cash value exceeds it. This allows you to leave more money to your loved ones when you're gone.
A policy's cash value accumulates tax-free.
When You Die
This is when the death benefit part of your policy kicks in. It can be used to pay:
- Your funeral and burial costs
- Any debts outstanding after you die
- Living expenses for your loved ones to replace your income
Most of the disadvantages of cash value life insurance are associated with costs and coverage limitations. Among them:
- High administrative fees and service fees for managing investment accounts
- High premiums when compared to term life insurance
- The interest rates earned on the cash value are usually less than other investment vehicles.
- If you take out a loan against the policy's cash value and don't pay it back before you die, the death benefit is reduced accordingly.
Managing Your Cash Value
If your policy's cash value exceeds the death benefit, you need to take action. Here's why:
If your policy's cash value exceeds the death benefit, you need to take action. Here's why:
When you die, your beneficiary only receives the policy's death benefit. If the policy's cash value amount is more than the death benefit, it goes to the insurance company.
To prevent this, either withdraw the cash value or check to see if your policy allows you to use the cash value to increase your death benefit. This way, your loved ones receive more inheritance.
There are two forms of life insurance: permanent life and term life . Only permanent life insurance provides cash value.
Permanent life insurance has four types: whole, universal, variable, and variable universal. The main difference between them is how the policy builds cash value.
- Whole Life Insurance
Has a guaranteed cash value. No matter how the stock market performs, your policy will earn a fixed interest amount.
Whole life also has a fixed death benefit and policy premium. That means they cannot be adjusted if your needs change.
- Universal Life Insurance
Guarantees a minimum cash value rate. However, the cash value can increase depending on money market rates.
Universal life offers flexible death benefit and premium amounts. You can increase or decrease them based on your needs.
- Variable Life Insurance
Has no guaranteed cash value. However, you have the option of selecting a fixed investment option or customizing your own investment plan. Investment options include stocks, equity funds, bonds, and money market funds.
Variable life offers flexible premium amounts and a guaranteed minimum death benefit. The amount of the death benefit is tied to the performance of the policy's cash value.
- Variable Universal Life Insurance
Has no guaranteed cash value. You invest your policy's cash value in investment options of your choosing. You can select from stocks, equity funds, bonds, and money market funds.
Variable universal life has a flexible death benefit and adjustable premiums. This allows you to increase or decrease both according to your needs.
For example, if your children are grown and the mortgage on your home is paid off, you may not need a $1 million death benefit. You can decrease it and, in turn, decrease your premium amount.
Unlike permanent life insurance options like cash value life, term life only provides a death benefit. Its coverage is offered for fixed periods, such as 30 years, 20 years, 15 years, and 10 years. That coverage expires when the selected term ends.
Here are the other differences between cash value and term life insurance:
- A term life insurance policy does not build cash value. It provides a death benefit only. Cash value provides both a death benefit and a savings vehicle.
- Term life insurance only pays out if you die within the policy's term. With cash value life insurance, you can withdraw the policy's cash value, borrow from it like a loan, or use it to reduce your premiums.
- Term life is temporary insurance. It insures the individual for a certain period of time. When the term expires, the insurance coverage ends. Cash value insurance is permanent and does not expire within a certain time period.
- Term life insurance costs much less than permanent cash value life insurance. The price difference is so substantial that many financial experts argue that term life is the preferred investment vehicle.
The cost of term life insurance increases considerably as you age. It is also more difficult to secure term life insurance at age 80 and older.
Opting for a term life insurance policy can save you a lot of money in premiums. Investing those savings can put you ahead of the game, according to experts.
Consider this example:
Tony buys a $1 million, 30-year term life insurance policy at age 32. His annual premium amount is $984.00.
Jeff is also 32 years old and also buys $1 million in life insurance coverage. But, he decides to buy a cash value life insurance policy. His annual premium is $10,023.60.
That's a difference of $9,039.60 annually that Tony could save and invest on his own. Over the 30-year term, that's about $270,000.
The stock market has an average rate of return of 7% . Using the money you'd save in premiums, your investment could yield $910,000.
Of course, Jeff has guaranteed financial security for him and his family. The cash value is also accessible to him to pay for any big expenses or to use for retirement. Tony must find an alternative investment means to financially secure his family's future.
Evaluate how much you could earn by investing the difference in premium costs on your own. Compare that estimate with your guaranteed cash value for the permanent life insurance policy and determine which option is best for your situation.
In general, finding the best cash value life insurance plan for you depends on you:
- Life and financial situation
- Investment interest and astuteness
- Current retirement plans
The four main types of cash value life insurance—whole life, variable life, universal life, and variable universal life—are designed to meet specific lifestyle needs. Keep reading to learn more.
Whole Life Insurance
A whole life policy is best for people who prefer consistency and reliability. They get this through whole life's guaranteed death benefit, fixed premiums, and guaranteed cash value.
Variable Life Insurance
This policy appeals to those who want to control the risk of investing without giving up flexibility. Variable life provides investment strategies that range from conservative to aggressive. The flexible death benefit and premium payments can be adjusted to match investment goals.
Universal Life Insurance
A universal life policy is a good match for those who want to build tax-free savings without much risk. They also do not plan on using the earnings any time soon. Universal life grows cash value over time, building an inheritance for the loved ones you leave behind.
Variable Universal Life Insurance
Variable universal life policies are best suited for people who want great flexibility. They want to be fully involved in monitoring the performance of their investment portfolio and changing the allocation of their policy's cash value accordingly.
Other Considerations
Here are other factors to weigh when choosing a permanent life insurance plan:
- Your family's expenses
- Estate planning if you have an estate
- College expenses
- Adult special needs family members or older family members who rely on your income
The goal of cash value life insurance is to meet your life's needs. That could mean:
- Giving you a guaranteed way to save for your future
- Ensuring financial security for your family if you die unexpectedly
- Paying off your debts so most of your assets go to your beneficiaries
- Saving for major expenses in the future
- Building a retirement nest egg
- Adding another savings vehicle if you maxed out other investment accounts
- Protecting your estate.
Whatever the case may be, the life insurance plan you select should match those needs.
A financial adviser or life insurance agent can help you decide which life insurance plan is best for you.
These professionals will conduct a financial needs analysis to determine your needs and budget. Then they will review all available options with you to be certain you are investing in the right vehicle for your life situation.
You can request quotes and comparison shop online for the best rate and plan. Most online insurance marketplaces also allow you to start the application process online after accepting a price quote.
You can also use a life insurance agent to purchase insurance. Read on to learn more.
Working With a Life Insurance Agent
If you prefer a more personal buying process, you can purchase permanent life insurance through an insurance agent or other financial broker in your local community.
Keep in mind that there are two types of life insurance agents: captive and independent.
Captive Agent
Works for a specific life insurance company and only sells that insurer's life insurance plans.
Independent Agent
Certified to sell life insurance plans from numerous life insurance companies.
A life insurance consultation with either type of life insurance agent is free.
Other Options
Some other ways to buy permanent cash value life insurance is through a membership group, such as a travel association or interest group in which you belong.
You also may be able to buy life insurance through your employer. Before doing so, inquire about the type of plan. Many businesses offer either term life insurance or accidental death and dismemberment insurance.
If you buy permanent life insurance through your employer, check to see if you have to surrender or terminate the policy if you are no longer working for the company.
Evaluating Your Choices
Before buying cash value life insurance directly on the internet or through an agent, be sure to:
Check the insurance company's rating.
- Ratings are assigned by independent rating companies, such as A.M. Best and Standard & Poor's. The ratings reflect the life insurer's financial strength. Look for a company with ratings in the ""A"" range, which indicate it is a financially sound life insurance company.
- Review customer comments or complaints. A good resource to see how a life insurance company handles service-related issues is the Better Business Bureau.
Check the credentials of the agent.
- Make sure the agent specializes in cash value life insurance.
- Check to see if the agent has professional life insurance or financial planning designations, such as CLU, LUTCF, ChFC, CFP, or FSS. These designations signify the agent has successfully completed advanced training in life insurance.
If everything checks out, the next step is applying for a life insurance policy. Expect the process to take about four to six weeks. During that time, the following takes place:
- You complete a comprehensive application that covers your:
- Current health status
- Medical history
- Family history
- Occupation and hobbies
- Driving record
- Current health status
- You take a medical exam arranged by the life insurance company. This exam is free and usually includes a blood test and urine sample.
Your application and medical exam results are reviewed by the life insurer's underwriting department. It rates your policy based on how risky it will be for the company to insure you. This is how the cost of your policy is determined.
- You receive the actual price of your life insurance plan and payment plan options.
- You decide whether to accept or decline the price. If you accept the policy, you submit your first payment.
- You receive your life insurance policy.
If you don't want to take the medical exam or have serious medical conditions that could lead to your application being denied, consider no-medical exam life insurance. No-questions-asked life insurance costs a bit more, but the time saved might be worth it.
After You Receive the Policy
Be sure to store your cash value life insurance policy in a safe place. And remember to update it as things change in life. This is especially important if you change your address or your beneficiary dies before you.
It's also a good idea to let your beneficiary know about the policy. This makes it easier to claim the death benefit when you're gone.
Cash value life insurance combines life insurance with a means of saving for your future. It's permanent insurance, so it doesn't expire after a certain period of time.
The savings component gives you control over how your money is invested. You can choose a policy with no risk, little risk, or moderate risk. You also have flexibility with the policy's death benefit and premium amounts.
Cash value life insurance is a good option for those looking for lifelong financial security for their loved ones. Affordability could be an issue since its premiums are high. However, in time, the cash value the policy builds can offset the cost.
Because of the complexity of cash value life insurance, it might be helpful to consult with a financial adviser or life insurance agent to determine if this is a good investment for you.
