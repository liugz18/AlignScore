Folks have liked it a lot and the feedback has been overwhelmingly positive. To meet our rather ambitious self-imposed target of ten thousand copies sold by the end of the Glastonbury Festival (our book climaxes at Glastonbury) we’ve been dialling up the advertising and asking anyone who’s read the book to leave a review. That means I’ve been checking the Amazon customer reviews fairly regularly, and that’s when I noticed that we received our first ever one-star review for the book. At first, my heart sank a little, but then I clicked on the review and had a read and this is what I found…
For context, here’s the part of the book that the reviewer objected to. Our hero, Jo, has travelled back in time from contemporary England to ‘90s Hollywood. She finds herself on a late night chat show where she reveals that she’s a time traveller…
There are two things going on with this review. First is an inability to make a distinction between the protagonist and the authors.
This still manages to surprise some readers. To write crime thrillers, you don’t need to be a cop or a murderer, to write science fiction you don’t need to explore deep space, and you, dear writer, can write repulsive characters and not agree with their world view.
Although, for the sake of clarity, here’s where I stand on Donald Trump. The man is a misogynist , homophobic , racist , narcissistic fool and a failed businessman whose time would be better spent indulging in his sexual peccadilloes behind closed doors while the rest of try and save the planet from climate change.
In short, I’m not a fan.
But this is what writers do: we put ourselves in the shoes of these characters and try to imagine would those people might be like — and very often it can be based on personal experience — and we try to convey that in words.
As an aside, I think this is why there is such a liberal bias in the entertainment industry. Creators will try and see both sides of the argument in a story, character or situation and present them in a compelling way. That sense of fairness is very much a characteristic of liberals, especially in contrast to the meritocratic views of the right.
The second aspect of the review is the disappointment in the reader that we’ve dragged the messy world of politics into their reading. This prompts the much bigger question: should writers get political? Sure, if you’re writing a political thriller it’s expected, but when you’re writing in an escapist genre like comedy, romance, science fiction or fantasy should the poor reader be inflicted with soap box politics? And is it worth it for the writer? Think back to The Dixie Chicks when they made disparaging comments about George W Bush and the effect that had on their sales. Isn’t it just safer to avoid any political content altogether?
Here’s the thing: all writing is political… if it’s any good.
Fiction isn’t like a family gathering where you avoid religion and politics. It should be a truthful reflection of what the creator believes, otherwise what is the point?
I’m not saying that our joke where Jo compares Trump to Hitler is some kind of profound insight into the human condition. Far from it. It’s simply the thing that stuck out for the reviewer. What that reviewer missed was the masses of other political content in the book. The themes of family, compassion, sexism, work, money and greed are threaded throughout the story, and if you don’t think those are political then you’ve not been paying attention to the world around you.
So, will we lose sales because we’ve upset some fans of Trump? Possibly. We’re hardly the Dixie Chicks, but to be honest if you’re a Trump supporter I don’t want your money. You’re going to need it when you realise you’re on the wrong side of history and need to pay for therapy.
In the meantime, I shall continue to write about the world through the eyes of characters that both attract and repulse me. It’s pretty much the only way I can make any sense of the chaos around me, especially that Trump fella…

The answer? Almost definitely not.
The catch is that controlling a super-intelligence far beyond human comprehension would require a simulation of that super-intelligence which we can analyze (and control). But if we're unable to comprehend it, it's impossible to create such a simulation.
Rules such as 'cause no harm to humans' can't be set if we don't understand the kind of scenarios that an AI is going to come up with, suggest the authors of the new paper. Once a computer system is working on a level above the scope of our programmers, we can no longer set limits.
""A super-intelligence poses a fundamentally different problem than those typically studied under the banner of 'robot ethics',"" wrote the researchers .
""This is because a superintelligence is multi-faceted, and therefore potentially capable of mobilizing a diversity of resources in order to achieve objectives that are potentially incomprehensible to humans, let alone controllable.""
Part of the team's reasoning came from the halting problem put forward by Alan Turing in 1936. The problem centers on knowing whether or not a computer program will reach a conclusion and answer (so it halts), or simply loop forever trying to find one.
As Turing proved through some smart math , while we can know that for some specific programs, it's logically impossible to find a way that will allow us to know that for every potential program that could ever be written. That brings us back to AI, which in a super-intelligent state could feasibly hold every possible computer program in its memory at once.
Any program written to stop AI from harming humans and destroying the world, for example, may reach a conclusion (and halt) or not – it's mathematically impossible for us to be absolutely sure either way, which means it's not containable.
""In effect, this makes the containment algorithm unusable,"" said computer scientist Iyad Rahwan from the Max-Planck Institute for Human Development in Germany in 2021.
The alternative to teaching AI some ethics and telling it not to destroy the world – something which no algorithm can be absolutely certain of doing, the researchers said – is to limit the capabilities of the super-intelligence. It could be cut off from parts of the internet or from certain networks, for example.
The study rejected this idea, too, suggesting that it would limit the reach of the artificial intelligence ; the argument goes that if we're not going to use it to solve problems beyond the scope of humans, then why create it at all?
If we are going to push ahead with artificial intelligence, we might not even know when a super-intelligence beyond our control arrives, such is its incomprehensibility. That means we need to start asking some serious questions about the directions we're going in.
""A super-intelligent machine that controls the world sounds like science fiction,"" said computer scientist Manuel Cebrian from the Max-Planck Institute for Human Development, also in 2021. ""But there are already machines that perform certain important tasks independently without programmers fully understanding how they learned it.""
""The question therefore arises whether this could at some point become uncontrollable and dangerous for humanity.""

Joe Biden turns 80 years old Sunday.
The 46th president of the United States, who, at 78, entered office as the oldest candidate to be elected, now becomes the only sitting president to celebrate his 80th birthday while in power.
Biden's age expects to be a continued talking point for the rest of his term, especially in the context of him potentially running for office again in 2024.
There's nothing in the U.S. Constitution barring someone from running because of old age – Article II only lists a minimum age of 35 years old.
On average, presidents are sworn in at 55 years old, according to POTUS.com.
Who are some of the other oldest presidents in U.S. history? Here's a list of ten oldest presidents when they took office.
Born Nov. 20, 1942, Joe Biden became the 46th president in January 2021, earning him the title of oldest president in U.S. history. Biden, who was 78 when he took the oath of office, has received sharp criticism throughout his administration from people who have questioned his age's impact on presidential performance.
Donald Trump , born June 14, 1946, was 70 years and 220 days when he took office as the 45th president in January 2017.
Born Feb. 6, 1911, the 40th president Ronald Regan was 69 years and 348 days old in 1980 when he was sworn-in.
Reagan survived an assassination attempt by gunshot in 1981 during his first-term and later surgery to remove a cancerous polyp in his large intestine in 1985.

Some argue that GMOs can benefit mankind by increasing the availability and quality of food, contributing to a cleaner environment, and filling gaps that conventional breeding cannot meet. Others point out that there is no evidence that GMOs are harmful to human health, and that they can help farmers use fewer environmentally damaging pesticides. However, some people have concerns about the long-term effects of GMOs on human health and the environment. Ultimately, whether or not GMOs should be allowed in food production is a complex issue with valid arguments on both sides.","Some argue that GMOs can benefit mankind by increasing the availability and quality of food, contributing to a cleaner environment, and filling gaps that conventional breeding cannot meet.","Agricultural plants are one of the most frequently cited examples of genetically modified organisms (GMOs). Some benefits of genetic engineering in agriculture are increased crop yields, reduced costs for food or drug production, reduced need for pesticides, enhanced nutrient composition and food quality, resistance to pests and disease , greater food security, and medical benefits to the world's growing population . Advances have also been made in developing crops that mature faster and tolerate aluminum, boron, salt, drought, frost, and other environmental stressors, allowing plants to grow in conditions where they might not otherwise flourish (Table 1; Takeda & Matsuoka, 2008). Other applications include the production of nonprotein (bioplastic) or nonindustrial (ornamental plant) products. A number of animals have also been genetically engineered to increase yield and decrease susceptibility to disease. For example, salmon have been engineered to grow larger (Figure 1) and mature faster (Table 1), and cattle have been enhanced to exhibit resistance to mad cow disease (United States Department of Energy, 2007).

The pharmaceutical industry is another frontier for the use of GMOs. In 1986, human growth hormone was the first protein pharmaceutical made in plants (Barta et al ., 1986), and in 1989, the first antibody was produced (Hiatt et al ., 1989). Both research groups used tobacco, which has since dominated the industry as the most intensively studied and utilized plant species for the expression of foreign genes (Ma et al ., 2003). As of 2003, several types of antibodies produced in plants had made it to clinical trials. The use of genetically modified animals has also been indispensible in medical research. Transgenic animals are routinely bred to carry human genes, or mutations in specific genes, thus allowing the study of the progression and genetic determinants of various diseases.
Many industries stand to benefit from additional GMO research. For instance, a number of microorganisms are being considered as future clean fuel producers and biodegraders. In addition, genetically modified plants may someday be used to produce recombinant vaccines. In fact, the concept of an oral vaccine expressed in plants (fruits and vegetables) for direct consumption by individuals is being examined as a possible solution to the spread of disease in underdeveloped countries, one that would greatly reduce the costs associated with conducting large-scale vaccination campaigns. Work is currently underway to develop plant-derived vaccine candidates in potatoes and lettuce for hepatitis B virus (HBV), enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli (ETEC), and Norwalk virus. Scientists are also looking into the production of other commercially valuable proteins in plants, such as spider silk protein and polymers that are used in surgery or tissue replacement (Ma et al ., 2003). Genetically modified animals have even been used to grow transplant tissues and human transplant organs, a concept called xenotransplantation. The rich variety of uses for GMOs provides a number of valuable benefits to humans, but many people also worry about potential risks.
Despite the fact that the genes being transferred occur naturally in other species, there are unknown consequences to altering the natural state of an organism through foreign gene expression . After all, such alterations can change the organism's metabolism , growth rate, and/or response to external environmental factors. These consequences influence not only the GMO itself, but also the natural environment in which that organism is allowed to proliferate. Potential health risks to humans include the possibility of exposure to new allergens in genetically modified foods, as well as the transfer of antibiotic-resistant genes to gut flora.
Horizontal gene transfer of pesticide, herbicide, or antibiotic resistance to other organisms would not only put humans at risk , but it would also cause ecological imbalances, allowing previously innocuous plants to grow uncontrolled, thus promoting the spread of disease among both plants and animals. Although the possibility of horizontal gene transfer between GMOs and other organisms cannot be denied, in reality, this risk is considered to be quite low. Horizontal gene transfer occurs naturally at a very low rate and, in most cases, cannot be simulated in an optimized laboratory environment without active modification of the target genome to increase susceptibility (Ma et al ., 2003).
In contrast, the alarming consequences of vertical gene transfer between GMOs and their wild-type counterparts have been highlighted by studying transgenic fish released into wild populations of the same species (Muir & Howard, 1999). The enhanced mating advantages of the genetically modified fish led to a reduction in the viability of their offspring . Thus, when a new transgene is introduced into a wild fish population, it propagates and may eventually threaten the viability of both the wild-type and the genetically modified organisms.
One example of public debate over the use of a genetically modified plant involves the case of Bt corn. Bt corn expresses a protein from the bacterium Bacillus thuringiensis . Prior to construction of the recombinant corn, the protein had long been known to be toxic to a number of pestiferous insects, including the monarch caterpillar, and it had been successfully used as an environmentally friendly insecticide for several years. The benefit of the expression of this protein by corn plants is a reduction in the amount of insecticide that farmers must apply to their crops. Unfortunately, seeds containing genes for recombinant proteins can cause unintentional spread of recombinant genes or exposure of non-target organisms to new toxic compounds in the environment.
The now-famous Bt corn controversy started with a laboratory study by Losey et al . (1999) in which the mortality of monarch larvae was reportedly higher when fed with milkweed (their natural food supply) covered in pollen from transgenic corn than when fed milkweed covered with pollen from regular corn. The report by Losey et al . was followed by another publication (Jesse & Obrycki, 2000) suggesting that natural levels of Bt corn pollen in the field were harmful to monarchs.
Debate ensued when scientists from other laboratories disputed the study, citing the extremely high concentration of pollen used in the laboratory study as unrealistic, and concluding that migratory patterns of monarchs do not place them in the vicinity of corn during the time it sheds pollen. For the next two years, six teams of researchers from government, academia, and industry investigated the issue and concluded that the risk of Bt corn to monarchs was ""very low"" (Sears et al ., 2001), providing the basis for the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency to approve Bt corn for an additional seven years.
Another concern associated with GMOs is that private companies will claim ownership of the organisms they create and not share them at a reasonable cost with the public. If these claims are correct, it is argued that use of genetically modified crops will hurt the economy and environment, because monoculture practices by large-scale farm production centers (who can afford the costly seeds) will dominate over the diversity contributed by small farmers who can't afford the technology. However, a recent meta-analysis of 15 studies reveals that, on average, two-thirds of the benefits of first-generation genetically modified crops are shared downstream, whereas only one-third accrues upstream (Demont et al ., 2007). These benefit shares are exhibited in both industrial and developing countries. Therefore, the argument that private companies will not share ownership of GMOs is not supported by evidence from first-generation genetically modified crops.
In a 2007 survey of 1,000 American adults conducted by the International Food Information Council (IFIC), 33% of respondents believed that biotech food products would benefit them or their families, but 23% of respondents did not know biotech foods had already reached the market. In addition, only 5% of those polled said they would take action by altering their purchasing habits as a result of concerns associated with using biotech products.
According to the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations, public acceptance trends in Europe and Asia are mixed depending on the country and current mood at the time of the survey (Hoban, 2004). Attitudes toward cloning, biotechnology, and genetically modified products differ depending upon people's level of education and interpretations of what each of these terms mean. Support varies for different types of biotechnology; however, it is consistently lower when animals are mentioned.
Furthermore, even if the technologies are shared fairly, there are people who would still resist consumable GMOs, even with thorough testing for safety, because of personal or religious beliefs. The ethical issues surrounding GMOs include debate over our right to ""play God,"" as well as the introduction of foreign material into foods that are abstained from for religious reasons. Some people believe that tampering with nature is intrinsically wrong, and others maintain that inserting plant genes in animals, or vice versa, is immoral. When it comes to genetically modified foods, those who feel strongly that the development of GMOs is against nature or religion have called for clear labeling rules so they can make informed selections when choosing which items to purchase. Respect for consumer choice and assumed risk is as important as having safeguards to prevent mixing of genetically modified products with non-genetically modified foods. In order to determine the requirements for such safeguards, there must be a definitive assessment of what constitutes a GMO and universal agreement on how products should be labeled.
These issues are increasingly important to consider as the number of GMOs continues to increase due to improved laboratory techniques and tools for sequencing whole genomes, better processes for cloning and transferring genes, and improved understanding of gene expression systems. Thus, legislative practices that regulate this research have to keep pace. Prior to permitting commercial use of GMOs, governments perform risk assessments to determine the possible consequences of their use, but difficulties in estimating the impact of commercial GMO use makes regulation of these organisms a challenge.
In 1971, the first debate over the risks to humans of exposure to GMOs began when a common intestinal microorganism, E. coli , was infected with DNA from a tumor-inducing virus (Devos et al ., 2007). Initially, safety issues were a concern to individuals working in laboratories with GMOs, as well as nearby residents. However, later debate arose over concerns that recombinant organisms might be used as weapons. The growing debate, initially restricted to scientists, eventually spread to the public, and in 1974, the National Institutes of Health (NIH) established the Recombinant DNA Advisory Committee to begin to address some of these issues.
In the 1980s, when deliberate releases of GMOs to the environment were beginning to occur, the U.S. had very few regulations in place. Adherence to the guidelines provided by the NIH was voluntary for industry. Also during the 1980s, the use of transgenic plants was becoming a valuable endeavor for production of new pharmaceuticals, and individual companies, institutions, and whole countries were beginning to view biotechnology as a lucrative means of making money (Devos et al ., 2007). Worldwide commercialization of biotech products sparked new debate over the patentability of living organisms, the adverse effects of exposure to recombinant proteins, confidentiality issues, the morality and credibility of scientists, the role of government in regulating science, and other issues. In the U.S., the Congressional Office of Technology Assessment initiatives were developed, and they were eventually adopted worldwide as a top-down approach to advising policymakers by forecasting the societal impacts of GMOs.
Then, in 1986, a publication by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), called ""Recombinant DNA Safety Considerations,"" became the first intergovernmental document to address issues surrounding the use of GMOs. This document recommended that risk assessments be performed on a case-by-case basis. Since then, the case-by-case approach to risk assessment for genetically modified products has been widely accepted; however, the U.S. has generally taken a product-based approach to assessment, whereas the European approach is more process based (Devos et al ., 2007). Although in the past, thorough regulation was lacking in many countries, governments worldwide are now meeting the demands of the public and implementing stricter testing and labeling requirements for genetically modified crops.
Proponents of the use of GMOs believe that, with adequate research, these organisms can be safely commercialized. There are many experimental variations for expression and control of engineered genes that can be applied to minimize potential risks. Some of these practices are already necessary as a result of new legislation, such as avoiding superfluous DNA transfer (vector sequences) and replacing selectable marker genes commonly used in the lab (antibiotic resistance) with innocuous plant-derived markers (Ma et al ., 2003). Issues such as the risk of vaccine-expressing plants being mixed in with normal foodstuffs might be overcome by having built-in identification factors, such as pigmentation, that facilitate monitoring and separation of genetically modified products from non-GMOs. Other built-in control techniques include having inducible promoters (e.g., induced by stress, chemicals, etc.), geographic isolation, using male-sterile plants, and separate growing seasons.
GMOs benefit mankind when used for purposes such as increasing the availability and quality of food and medical care, and contributing to a cleaner environment. If used wisely, they could result in an improved economy without doing more harm than good, and they could also make the most of their potential to alleviate hunger and disease worldwide. However, the full potential of GMOs cannot be realized without due diligence and thorough attention to the risks associated with each new GMO on a case-by-case basis.

The Brennan Center for Justice has documented cases of wealthy donors using super PACs to gain access to and influence over the political process, and has warned that the current campaign finance system is in far worse shape. Congress should take steps to ensure that super PACs are not used to influence the political process.",Congress should take steps to ensure that super PACs are not used to influence the political process.,"Congress is on the brink of passing the biggest stimulus bill in history. The last time there was legislation like this, super PACs didn’t exist. Today, the campaign finance regulation system is in far worse shape, and wealthy donors can use their influence to try to obtain big payouts from the government.
Meanwhile, the influence of unlimited big money has already been affecting the 2020 election. The evidence is everywhere from one donor spending nearly $15 million through a super PAC backing one primary candidates to the presidential contenders arguing at a debate about accepting money from wealthy supporters through super PACs.
The law limits the amount one individual can donate directly to a campaign, in part because of fears that that type of transaction could lead to corruption. But wealthy donors are still able to exert immense influence over our political process, thanks in part to a federal appeals court decision 10 years ago this month that was based on the Supreme Court’s Citizens United ruling .
In SpeechNow v. Federal Election Commission , the DC Circuit Court of Appeals required the FEC to allow organizations to register as “independent expenditure only committees,” a status that lets groups raise unlimited money from donors. Millionaires, billionaires, and corporations skirt individual limits by donating to these groups, which we now know as super PACs.
The groups — which are often staffed by former employees of the candidates — throw their money and resources behind candidates or political causes favored by the wealthy donors. The process drowns out the voices of regular voters, giving the superrich a level of access to and influence over the political process that’s impossible for the vast majority of Americans to obtain. Examples abound over the last decade.
The most recent high-profile one involves Lev Parnas and Igor Fruman, two Ukrainian-American businessmen who used large contributions to a pro-Trump super PAC to get facetime with the president. They took the opportunity to advocate for the ouster of the U.S. ambassador to Ukraine, Marie Yovanovitch, a move they viewed as benefiting their own interests and those of another Ukrainian government official.
Or there’s the case of Jose Susumo Azano Matsura, a Mexican businessman interested in building a waterfront development in San Diego. He was convicted in 2016 of funneling $500,000 in illegal foreign money into a San Diego mayoral race to gain support for the project, using a shell company and super PAC to disguise the foreign source of much of the funds.
Real estate was also a factor one year later on the east coast, when former Miami Beach Commissioner Michael Grieco pleaded no contest to charges resulting from a scheme that involved secretly setting up his own super PAC and accepting disguised donations from a Norwegian citizen interested in developing properties in the city.
And just this month, North Carolina insurance magnate Greg Lindberg was convicted of attempting to bribe the state insurance commissioner to replace an official who was investigating a company Lindberg owned. The lion’s share of the payments — $1.5 million — went through a super PAC Lindberg had created for the purpose. He was caught on tape explaining how his donations to a super PAC would benefit the insurance commissioner’s campaign.
There are also cases where the influence of super PAC money was not outright illegal but has an appearance of corruption nonetheless.
When Congress was considering an unpopular tax reform package in 2017, Cory Bliss — the head of the Congressional Leadership Fund and close ally of House Speaker Paul Ryan — gave House Republicans an ultimatum: the group would not support members who voted against the bill. As the tax reform moved through Congress, senators and representatives were frank about their motivation to pass it to please donors . The Congressional Leadership Fund went on to be the highest-spending super PAC in 2018, shelling out $138 million in support of GOP candidates.
And in Washington, DC, supporters of Mayor Muriel Bowser were forced to shut down their super PAC when scandal erupted over big contributions from donors seeking business contracts with the district. One donor described giving to the super PAC this way : “If you want to continue to have good favor with the mayor, it is something you do.”
Just 11 donors have given $1 billion to super PACs over the years, and more than two-thirds of super PAC funding comes from donations of $1 million or more . Super PAC spending has sharply risen from $600 million in 2012 to over $1 billion in 2016.
Fortunately, powerful reform options are available. The key is public financing, which empowers regular people and the candidates they support to run competitive campaigns without seeking super PAC help. These programs match and multiply small donations with public funds, so that $50 from a constituent becomes worth $350 to the candidate, for example. The idea is not to eliminate big super PAC money, but to give candidates not supported by wealthy donors the resources to compete for office.
Public financing has seen success in several cities , from Los Angeles to New York City, where candidates raise most of their funds from small donors. The programs improve the connection between representative and constituent by rewarding retail fundraising in the community rather than ritzy fundraisers and wink-and-nod arrangements with super PACs. Several cities and counties have created public financing systems in response to Citizens United . A bill has also passed the House of Representatives. With every legislative advance, this reform can help our elections change course after a decade of super PACs.",source_text/0ad9925073ea36750fc6e5be0788141c30c8d9e489d15caacf1fcc14791ee004-neeva_1_0.txt,,no_support,True,pacs - corporate - political - donations - bribery - candidates - corporations - campaign - campaigns - legally,StanfordCitation,0.5,0.49,0.5,0.47,[0.22465002536773682],[0.22465002536773682]

Throughout that time, the franchise's twelve films (nine mainline, one spinoff, and two shorts) have woven together a convoluted narrative that's proven a bit difficult to follow. So ahead of the upcoming Fast and Furious film: Fast X , we've put together this handy guide on how to watch the Fast and Furious movies in chronological order.
At the bottom of the article, you'll find a second list that orders the films by their actual release dates, if you’d prefer to watch them in that order instead. Considering its lack of importance to the film series’ ongoing narrative, we aren’t including the animated series Fast & Furious: Spy Racers .

The Fast and Furious Movies in (Chronological) Order
There are currently 10 Fast and Furious movies , 2 short films, and an animated series. With Fast X already announced, there is seemingly no end to the Fast and Furious cinematic universe. See our guide on where to watch every Fast and Furious movie for streaming details.
Where to watch : Amazon Prime Video
The timeline begins with the franchise's first film, 2001's The Fast and the Furious. The fairly straightforward action plot tasks Paul Walker's undercover cop Brian O'Conner with taking down a crew of carjackers led by Vin Diesel's Dom Toretto. Brian gets involved in illegal street racing, befriends Dom, starts dating his sister (Jordan Brewster's Mia Toretto), and ultimately chooses those relationships over his duty as a cop. The first film also introduces viewers to series staple Michelle Rodriguez, who plays Letty Ortiz, Dom's love interest.

The Turbo Charged Prelude for 2 Fast 2 Furious shows how Brian O’Conner, on the run from law enforcement, gets from LA to Miami before the events of 2 Fast 2 Furious. The six-minute short film features no dialogue and a handful of races. It’s nonessential viewing, but it’s here nonetheless.
Where to watch : Amazon Prime Video
The series’ only movie without Dom Toretto, 2 Fast 2 Furious introduces Roman Pearce (Tyrese GIbson) and Tej Parker (Chris “Ludacris” Bridges). The story follows Brian O’Connor and Pearce as they go undercover to take down a drug lord in exchange for having their criminal records expunged — a mission that's ultimately successful. It also introduces a new love interest for O’Connor in Eva Mendes’s Monica Fuentes, who only appears again briefly in Fast Five.

The second of the series’ two short films, Los Bandoleros takes place between Fast 1 and Fast 4, though its exact placement on the timeline is never specified. Written and directed by Vin Diesel, Los Bandoleros is set in the Dominican Republic, where Dom is lying low after the events of Fast 1. In its 20-minute runtime, the film manages to cover an oil war, corrupt politics, and a prison break, culminating in a romantic reunion between Dom and Letty. Chronologically, it’s also the first time we see Sung Kang’s death-defying Han Lue.

Not to be confused with The Fast and the Furious , Fast & Furious is the franchise's fourth mainline film, though it precedes Tokyo Drift (film number three) in the chronology. It's a sequel to Fast 1, set five years later, with Dom and Brian teaming up once again to take down a drug lord and avenge the “death” of Letty. Dom is ultimately arrested and sentenced, though en route to the prison, Brian, Mia, and Tego Leo (Tego Calderon) are seen intercepting the prison bus. Fast & Furious also introduces Gal Gadot’s Gisele Yashar. It was the Wonder Woman actor's first major film role.

Frequent series director Justin Lin’s third Fast movie raised the stakes with massive setpieces and a supersized cast featuring Dwayne Johnson’s Luke Hobbs. Picking up where Fast & Furious left off, Dom heads to Rio de Janeiro with Mia and Brian after escaping his prison transport. A familiar tale unfolds: They steal and race souped-up street cars while on the run from another government agency, this time Luke Hobbs and the DEA. Eva Mendes’s Monica Fuentes returns in a mid-credits scene to reveal Letty is still alive.
Fast 6 begins with Dom and his crew once again on the lam. Hobbs, meanwhile, is looking to take down a mercenary group led by Luke Evans’s Owen Shaw. Hobbs recruits Dom by showing him a picture of Letty, whom Dom believes to be dead, and offering him and his crew amnesty back in the U.S. As always, there are vehicular shenanigans and casualties, though things ultimately end well for the crew, and the franchise carries on. The post-credits scene introduces Jason Statham’s Deckard Shaw to the series.

The wackiest of the Fast movies timeline-wise is the series’ third movie, which actually takes place between Fast 6 and 7. The first Fast movie directed by Justin Lin features a Dom cameo but largely centers around teenage street racers Sean Boswell (Lucas Black) and Twinkie (Shad ""Bow Wow"" Moss), with series staple Han Lue serving as a mentor to Sean. With a $62 million haul, it's the series’ least successful entry by box office total.
The series’ biggest box office success to date is Furious 7, which grossed over $350 million — no other Fast film has cleared $250 million. It’s also the most well-received critically with a Rotten Tomatoes score of 82% (five points better than runner-up Fast Five). Furious 7 picks up at the end of Tokyo Drift, with Statham’s Deckard Shaw serving as the main villain. It was directed by James Wan (Saw, The Conjuring, Aquaman).
This is the last Fast film with Paul Walker’s Brian O’Conner, as Walker died during the time of its filming. Furious 7 ends with an emotional farewell to Brian/Walker.

Order is restored here as Fast 8 follows Fast 7 in both the real and fictional timelines. The film’s stacked cast includes Charlize Theron, Russell Crowe, Scott Eastwood, and Helen Mirren, alongside series regulars Vin Diesel, Michelle Rodriguez, Tyrese Gibson, Ludacris, Dwayne Johson, and Jason Statham. In addition to the expected dose of fast cars, over-the-top action, and double-crossing, Fast 8 finds time for cyberterrorism and the threat of nuclear war.

The series’ only spinoff film to date stars Johnson’s Luke Hobbs and Statham’s Deckard Shaw. The duo, who became buddies after escaping prison together in the previous film, are tasked with saving humanity from a deadly virus. The spinoff also brings the legendary Idris Elba into the fold as villainous super soldier Brixton Lore.
Back in 2020, Johnson said he was working on a Hobbs and Shaw sequel , though he vowed to never again appear in the mainline films due to a feud with Vin Diesel . So as it stands there are currently no discussions happening for a sequel .
The series’ most recent film, once again directed by Justin Lin, pits Dom and the crew against Jakob Toretto, Dom’s estranged brother played by John Cena. The family’s all here for this one, as nearly every major series player to date returns, in addition to new blood like Cena, Michael Rooker, and Cardi B. The plot involves another threat to humanity: Project Aries, a device capable of controlling all of the world's weapon systems. As always, that plot is foiled, in part thanks to Roman and Tej flying a Pontiac into space.

Fast X is set to be the final chapter in the Fast and Furious franchise. Dom will have to protect his family from a new enemy named Dante (Jason Momoa) who is looking for revenge after the death of his father in Fast 5. Fast X won't be released in theaters unil May 19, 2023.

This reaction is known as an acid-catalyzed aldol condensation. The acid-catalyzed aldol condensation is a condensation reaction in organic chemistry in which an enol or an enolate ion reacts with a carbonyl compound to form a β-hydroxyaldehyde or β-hydroxyketone, followed by dehydration to give a conjugated enone. Therefore, aldol condensation can take place in acidic medium.",This reaction is known as an acid-catalyzed aldol condensation.,"In a previous post we explored keto- enol tautomerism [ See post: Keto-Enol Tautomerism ] and described how the enol tautomer is the nucleophilic alter-ego of the electrophilic keto tautomer. In this article we’ll get into some more practical aspects, namely: what kinds of reactions do enols undergo?
Although not nearly as nucleophilic as enolates [ Note 1 ], enols do play a key role in several important organic reactions.
In this article we’ll look at three important examples:
- Halogenation of ketones
- The acid-catalyzed aldol condensation.
- The Mannich reaction (which is a lot like the aldol except that the enol adds to a C-N pi bond instead of a C-O pi bond)
If you look closely at each of the three reactions above, you will note that each of them are catalyzed by acid .
Why is that? Let’s have a closer look.
Let’s set the stage with a reaction that doesn’t really seem to accomplish all that much.
If you take a solution of an enantiomerically pure, optically active ketone like this one [ (S) -2-methylcyclohexanone] add a few drops of strong acid and stir overnight, you’ll come back the next morning to find that its optical activity has completely disappeared . [ Note 2 – acetic acid isn’t strong enough, but a few drops of HBr will do ]
It’s still 2-methylcyclohexanone, but it’s become an equal mixture of the ( R ) and ( S ) enantiomers . A racemic mixture in other words. (See post: What’s a racemic mixture ?)
In contrast, if you take a very similar enantiomerically pure ketone (3-methyl cyclohexanone) and perform the exact same sequence, the optical activity will remain unchanged .
What’s going on here?
Both ketones can undergo tautomerism to give the enol form, where C-2 is trigonal planar (sp 2 hybridized). However, the enol form of 2-methylcyclohexanone, no longer has a chiral center. The enol form is achiral.
When this flat, achiral enol is then protonated by acid to regenerate 2-methylcyclohexanone, it will do so with equal likelihood from the top and bottom face, resulting in an equal (i.e. racemic) mixture of the (R) and (S) enantiomers .
On the other hand, ( S )-3-methylcyclohexanone retains its optical activity since its chiral center isn’t destroyed when the enol is formed.
A reaction where two substituents on a chiral center are interchanged (with one of them usually being H) is called epimerization.
Epimerization of the alpha-carbon of ketones and aldehydes can readily occur in the presence of acid and base. Carbons further down the chain are not affected since it is only the alpha carbon that is acidic.
Could the same experiment have been performed without acid? Yes – but it would have been much slower.
Acid helps to catalyze keto- enol tautomerism, allowing for rapid equilibrium between the keto and enol forms.
How specifically does acid help here?
If you go way back in time to Org 1, you might find a reaction buried deep in your memory banks called the E1 reaction. (See post: The E1 Reaction and Its Mechanism )
After the leaving group leaves, the next step in the E1 is deprotonation of the carbon next to the carbocation to give a new pi bond. The E1 requires only a weak base for this step ( even water will do! ) since the leaving group has already left and the carbon has an empty p-orbital available to form the new pi-bond. (Remember that the E2 requires a stronger base in order to get that leaving group to leave – See post: The E2 Mechanism ).
The carbon of a protonated aldehyde or ketone is very similar to a carbocation . It has a significant resonance form where the formal charge is on carbon and the oxygen is neutral. [ Note 3 ]
Deprotonation of the C-H next to the carbonyl (pK a <0 ) is therefore considerably easier than it would be in the case of the neutral aldehyde / ketone ( pK a = 16)
TL: DR Adding acid makes it easier to deprotonate C-H and therefore makes formation of the enol much easier.
Acid also helps with the conversion of the enol back to the ketone , which involves (slow) protonation of the alpha-carbon followed by (fast) deprotonation of O-H.
For the acid-catalyzed conversion of enol to keto, hover here and an image will pop up or click on this link .
Since both the forward and backward reactions are accelerated, that’s what we mean when we say that acid “helps to establish the equilibrium”.
Now let’s look at some of the reactions of enols.
Enols are really just electron-rich alkenes , and will undergo many of the same reactions. You might recall that alkenes will readily attack halogens such as Br 2 to give dihalides, for example. ( See post: Bromination of alkenes )
If you add strong acid to a ketone , and mix in a halogen (Cl 2 , Br 2 , I 2 ), you obtain a new alpha-halo ketone .
In the absence of acid, the reaction is “exceedingly slow”. [ Note 4 ] Furthermore, careful measurements show that adding an excess of Br 2 does not increase the reaction rate.
Knowing this, a mechanism that makes sense is a (slow) conversion of the ketone to its enol form, followed by (fast) halogenation.
When more than one enol can be formed from the same ketone , the halogen will add to whichever enol form is the most favored at equilibrium (generally the most substituted – see previous post on keto- enol tautomerism for more details).

Previously we saw how the conjugate base of enols (known as “ enolates “) can add to aldehydes and ketones, a reaction known as the aldol reaction . (See post: The Aldol Addition and Condensation )
Enols can also perform the aldol reaction aldehydes and ketones, if an acid catalyst is present to help move things along. The acid-catalyzed aldol reaction almost always results in the condensation product (loss of H 2 O), even without heat.
Being harder to control, the acid-catalyzed aldol tends to get less use than the base-catalyzed version. [ Note 5 ] Still, it’s instructive because it actually highlights three key ways that acid can catalyze reactions, which roughly highlights the three stages of this reaction.
In the first stage, acid catalyzes keto- enol tautomerism , which provides us with our nucleophile (the enol ) as seen previously.
In the second stage, acid protonates the oxygen of an aldehyde or ketone . The resulting conjugate acid of the aldehyde / ketone is a much better electrophile at carbon, owing to a contribution from a key resonance form with a positive charge on carbon [ Note 3 ].
The protonated aldehyde / ketone then undergoes addition from the nucleophilic enol , resulting in the aldol addition product (after deprotonation).
The third stage of the acid-catalyzed aldol highlights how the conjugate acid is a better leaving group . Protonation of the hydroxyl group (OH) of the addition product results in the much better leaving group H 2 O.
In one version of this mechanism, water is “pushed out” by the enol form of the addition product. Simultaneous formation of C-O (pi) and migration of C-C (pi) in what can be called a “1,4-elimination” or “conjugate elimination” step. There are other ways to show this occurring, which are detailed in the notes. [ Note 6 ]
Deprotonation of oxygen then results in the neutral aldol condensation product.
Here are a few examples of aldol condensation reactions, including an example of an intramolecular acid-catalyzed aldol condensation.
The acid-catalyzed aldol reaction can also happen intramolecularly. There is a variant of the Robinson Annulation that uses acid, for example. (See post: The Robinson Annulation )
The Mannich reaction is a close relative of the aldol reaction, except the electrophile is a C=N bond instead of a C=O.
The electrophile in the Mannich is generally not a neutral imine, but a positively charged iminium ion .
The first stage of the Mannich reaction is – you guessed it! – formation of the enol tautomer.
In the second stage, the enol adds to the iminium ion. Deprotonation then leads to the neutral product.
Like the aldol, if it’s done under acidic conditions, the reaction will proceed through the more-substituted enol .
So what have we learned? A few things.
- Enols are the key nucleophilic intermediate in halogenation , the acid-catalyzed aldol reaction , and the Mannich reaction .
- Acid catalyzes keto- enol tautomerism ; the alpha-carbon of the protonated carbonyl is considerably more acidic than that of the neutral aldehyde or ketone .
- An aldehyde or ketone with a chiral center on the alpha carbon will undergo epimerization in the presence of strong acid.
- Treating an aldehyde or ketone with Br 2 in the presence of strong acid (HBr) will form a new C-Br bond on the alpha carbon . No reaction occurs in the absence of strong acid.
- Acid can catalyze the aldol condensation . Acid assists in 1)promoting keto- enol tautomerism, 2) in activating the carbonyl towards attack by the enol nucleophile , and 3) facilitates elimination through making the resulting OH group into a better leaving group .
- The Mannich reaction is similar to the aldol reaction but involves addition of an enol to a C=N bond instead of a C=O bond. It is also catalyzed by acid.
Note 1 – “Enols not as nucleophlic as enolates.” The conjugate base is always a better nucleophile than the corresponding neutral species. One quantification for RO(-) versus ROH, for example, has CH 3 CH 2 O(–) at about 10 orders of magnitude more nucleophilic than CH 3 CH 2 OH [see Mayr’s website here for the source – you might have to dig around].
There isn’t a similar treatment for comparing the nucleophilicity of similar enolates versus enols (they are harder to study) but 10 orders of magnitude is probably a good guess.
Note 2 – “ acetic acid isn’t strong enough, but a few drops of HBr will do”. In one study, it was found that the speed of racemization of an enantiomerically pure ketone was extremely slow in acetic acid / chloroform but very rapid in the presence of traces of HBr. ( the ketone was 2-o-carboxybenzylindan-1-one , see J. Chem. Soc. 1934 773 ).
Note 3 – “ It has a significant resonance form where the formal charge is on carbon and the oxygen is neutral” .
One intuitive way of gauging how much “carbocation” character the ketone has is to compare the relative contributions made by the carbocation-containing resonance form to the overall resonance hybrid. (The intuitive rules for gauging the relative importance of resonance forms is covered here, 4 Rules For Evaluating Resonance Structure s). Two key items relevant here are the number of point charges (zero is preferred) and the number of atoms with full octets (zero is preferred).
In the case of the neutral ketone , the resonance form with the carbocation has two point charges (versus zero for the C=O form) in addition to the lack of a full octet on C.
Once the carbonyl is protonated, both resonance forms have the same number of point charges (one). Therefore the resonance form where carbon lacks a full octet (the carbocation) will be less bad overall , and therefore the carbocation will make a greater contribution to the resonance hybrid, relative to non-protonated carbonyl .
One way to quantify this effect is to examine C=O stretches in IR spectroscopy, since the stronger the bond, the higher the wavenumber. Neutral acetone has a C=O stretch at 1765 cm -1 whereas protonated acetone has a C=O stretch at 1580 cm -1 . That demonstrates a significant weakening of the C-O pi bond.
The same argument can be made for why the positively charged iminium ion is a better electrophile than a neutral imine .
Note 4 – “ in the absence of acid, bromination is exceedingly slow”. This is a direct quote from Lapworth ( ref ) in his seminal study on acid-catalyzed bromination.
Note 5 – “ the acid-catalyzed aldol tends to get less use than the base-catalyzed version.” The base-promoted aldol gets more use because it’s much easier to control which enolate you can form through use of the appropriate base. In the acid-catalyzed aldol you are held hostage to whichever enol form is more thermodynamically stable.
However there is a version of the aldol reaction called the Mukaiyama aldol reaction which proceeds with an enol ether as the nucleophile , and employs strong Lewis acids (e.g. TiCl 4 , which smokes in the presence of air) to assist their reactions with aldehydes.
Note 6 – “ There are other ways to show this occurring, which are detailed in the notes. “
The elimination going through a conjugate elimination process is was determined in this study of the self-condensation of acetaldehyde (see ref ).
There is some variation on how this step is shown in textbooks, and furthermore, there is also variation on how this happens in real life.
One way this is sometimes shown is as an E1 -type reaction where water leaves, and there is a subsequent deprotonation event. This can happen; it’s most correct in cases where that would lead to a resonance stabilized carbocation (e.g. adjacent to an electron-rich aromatic ring). One prominent example can be found here. [ Ref ]
This goes way beyond what anyone reading this would likely care about, but there is also precedent for the OH group to undergo substitution (likely via S N 1) to a good leaving group , which subsequently is removed with weak base (or via E1 ). This is known for the self-aldol condensation of cyclohexanone with HCl, for example.
One thing I can feel comfortable saying is that you should not draw this as an E2 type reaction. It requires an anti-periplanar arrangement of the C-H and C-OH2 bonds, and I’m not aware of any evidence that this process depends on stereochemistry (the same way you see in the E2 ).

The acid-catalyzed aldol reaction has been known since 1838, which makes it one of the longest-known organic reactions of all time. The first example was the dimerization of acetone , from J. Prakt. Chem 1838, 15, 129 .
1. Optically Active Esters of B-Ketonic and B-Aldehydic Acids. Part II. Menthyl Acetoacetate

A very instructive paper and one of the earliest examples containing a definitive proof of the role of acid in accelerating keto- enol tautomerism. The authors prepared the me n thyl ( not methyl) ester of acetoacetic acid [(+)-menthol is an optically active alcohol readily available from natural sources] and measured its optical activity. They found that the me n thyl ester underwent mutarotation to an extent that was dependent on the solvent, with the rate of mutarotation being highly dependent on acid. This demonstrates the establishment of an equilibrium between the keto and enol forms.

Pioneering study on halogenation of carbonyl compounds.
“Bromination of acetone under the conditions maintained is best regarded as the result of a slow, reversible change effected in the acetone by the hydrogen ions, followed by an almost instantaneous bromination of the product, a change which is not appreciably reversible. This intermediate product is perhaps the enolic form of the ketone , as it has been already shown that in many cases the rapid attainment of equilibrium between the tautomeric forms of carbonyl compounds is brought about by acids.”

Rate of bromination is essentially the same as the rate of racemization, consistent with enol formation as the rate-limiting step. “In chloroform and glacial acetic acid, racemization of the d - ketone was extremely slow but became very rapid in the presence of traces of hydrogen bromide”.

This paper studies the acid-catalyzed aldol reaction of methyl ethyl ketone and various substituted benzaldehydes. The key nugget here is that the final dehydration step is proposed to occur through the enol form of the addition product when the aromatic ring has an electron-neutral (Ph) or electron poor (NO 2 ) group in the para position, but through ionization (i.e. benzyl carbocation formation) with an electron-rich (OCH3) group in the para position. Stated reason is that there is only a 3fold change in rate for elimination step from p-methyoxyl to 3-nitro, inconsistent with what one would see if it involved a benzyl carbonium ion.
Worth noting that Donald Noyce’s brother was physicist Robert Noyce , the co-founder of Intel.

Extensive physical-organic-chemistry study on the acid-catalyzed aldol condensation of the simple aldehyde , ethanal (acetaldehyde). The rate-limiting step is addition of the enol to protonated acetaldehyde. Notably their work is also consistent with the elimination of water occurring from the enol form of the addition product.
Two other useful snippets: “acetaldehyde is completely protonated to its conjugate acid in H 2 SO 4 stronger than 64%. “Enolization of ketones is known to involve two water molecules acting together as a base”.

It is an important site in prehistory, as it marks the beginning of art. It is located near the modern city of Konya in south central Turkey.","Çatalhöyük was an early example of a large, settled community, with up to 8000 people living together in a town.","The city of Çatalhöyük points to one of man’s most important transformations, from nomad to settled farmer.
Çatalhöyük or Çatal Höyük (pronounced “cha-tal hay OOK”) is not the oldest site of the Neolithic era or the largest, but it is extremely important to the beginning of art. Located near the modern city of Konya in south central Turkey, it was inhabited 9000 years ago by up to 8000 people who lived together in a large town. Çatalhöyük, across its history, witnesses the transition from exclusively hunting and gathering subsistence to increasing skill in plant and animal domestication. We might see Çatalhöyük as a site whose history is about one of man’s most important transformations: from nomad to settler. It is also a site at which we see art, both painting and sculpture, appear to play a newly important role in the lives of settled people.
Çatalhöyük had no streets or foot paths; the houses were built right up against each other and the people who lived in them traveled over the town’s rooftops and entered their homes through holes in the roofs, climbing down a ladder. Communal ovens were built above the homes of Çatalhöyük and we can assume group activities were performed in this elevated space as well.
Like at Jericho, the deceased were placed under the floors or platforms in houses and sometimes the skulls were removed and plastered to resemble live faces. The burials at Çatalhöyük show no significant variations, either based on wealth or gender; the only bodies which were treated differently, decorated with beads and covered with ochre, were those of children. The excavator of Çatalhöyük believes that this special concern for youths at the site may be a reflection of the society becoming more sedentary and required larger numbers of children because of increased labor, exchange and inheritance needs.
Art is everywhere among the remains of Çatalhöyük, geometric designs as well as representations of animals and people. Repeated lozenges and zigzags dance across smooth plaster walls, people are sculpted in clay, pairs of leopards are formed in relief facing one another at the sides of rooms, hunting parties are painted baiting a wild bull. The volume and variety of art at Çatalhöyük is immense and must be understood as a vital, functional part of the everyday lives of its ancient inhabitants.
Many figurines have been found at the site, the most famous of which illustrates a large woman seated on or between two large felines. The figurines, which illustrate both humans and animals, are made from a variety of materials but the largest proportion are quite small and made of barely fired clay. These casual figurines are found most frequently in garbage pits, but also in oven walls, house walls, floors and left in abandoned structures. The figurines often show evidence of having been poked, scratched or broken, and it is generally believed that they functioned as wish tokens or to ward off bad spirits.
Nearly every house excavated at Çatalhöyük was found to contain decorations on its walls and platforms, most often in the main room of the house. Moreover, this work was constantly being renewed; the plaster of the main room of a house seems to have been redone as frequently as every month or season. Both geometric and figural images were popular in two-dimensional wall painting and the excavator of the site believes that geometric wall painting was particularly associated with adjacent buried youths.
Figural paintings show the animal world alone, such as, for instance, two cranes facing each other standing behind a fox, or in interaction with people, such as a vulture pecking at a human corpse or hunting scenes. Wall reliefs are found at Çatalhöyük with some frequency, most often representing animals, such as pairs of animals facing each other and human-like creatures. These latter reliefs, alternatively thought to be bears, goddesses or regular humans, are always represented splayed, with their heads, hands and feet removed, presumably at the time the house was abandoned.
The most remarkable art found at Çatalhöyük, however, are the installations of animal remains and among these the most striking are the bull bucrania. In many houses the main room was decorated with several plastered skulls of bulls set into the walls (most common on East or West walls) or platforms, the pointed horns thrust out into the communal space. Often the bucrania would be painted ochre red. In addition to these, the remains of other animals’ skulls, teeth, beaks, tusks or horns were set into the walls and platforms, plastered and painted. It would appear that the ancient residents of Çatalhöyük were only interested in taking the pointy parts of the animals back to their homes!
How can we possibly understand this practice of interior decoration with the remains of animals? A clue might be in the types of creatures found and represented. Most of the animals represented in the art of Çatalhöyük were not domesticated; wild animals dominate the art at the site. Interestingly, examination of bone refuse shows that the majority of the meat which was consumed was of wild animals, especially bulls. The excavator believes this selection in art and cuisine had to do with the contemporary era of increased domestication of animals and what is being celebrated are the animals which are part of the memory of the recent cultural past, when hunting was much more important for survival.

Repo rate is defined as the rate of interest at which the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) lends money to commercial banks. ''Repo'' stands for Repurchase Agreement or Repurchasing Option. Banks avail loans from the central bank (the RBI) by selling eligible securities. An agreement between the central bank and the commercial bank will be made to repurchase the securities at a price that is predetermined. This is done when banks face a shortage of funds or need to maintain liquidity in volatile market conditions. The RBI uses the repo rate to control inflation rates.

As mentioned earlier, the repo rate is used by the central bank of India to control the flow of money in the market. When the market is hit by inflation, RBI increases the repo rate. An increased repo rate denotes that the banks who borrow money during this period from the central bank will have to pay higher interest. This discourages the banks to borrow money, which in turn, reduces the supply of money in the market and helps negate the inflation. Similarly, the repo rates are decreased in the case of a recession.
On the basis of the economic condition, as discussed in the last paragraph, the RBI regulates the repo rate. The rates are decided by the central bank on the basis of the inflation or recession in the market of the country.
Repo Rate vs Reverse Repo Rate is one of the most important topics that we need to understand. The difference can be listed as follows:
- Repo rate is charged against funds lent by the RBI to commercial banks and other financial institutions.The reverse repo rate, on the other hand, is the rate of interest that is offered by the central bank to the commercial banks who deposit funds in the RBI treasury.
- Repo rate is always higher than the reverse repo rate.
- Repo rate helps to control the inflation in the market. The reverse repo rate, on the other hand, helps to control the supply of money in the market.
Marginal Cost of funds based Lending Rate or MCLR is a reference rate which is used internally for ascertaining the interest rate which can be levied by the banks on loans.
The repo rate, on the other hand, is an interest rate which is determined by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) and charged against the funds lent by the central bank to commercial banks and all other financial institutions.
The effect of repo rate on the life of common man is direct in terms of the increase in the overall interest. As discussed earlier, repo rate is the rate of interest which is charged by the RBI for funds lent to the commercial banks.
When the repo rate increases, the interest rate at which commercial banks borrow money from the central bank increases and the borrowing becomes costlier. In turn, the commercial banks increase their lending rates to cope up with the hike in the repo rate. Thus, when common men borrow money from the commercial banks, the effective interest rate becomes higher and they end up paying higher interest amounts for the loan that they borrow.
The repo rate is used by the central bank of India to control the supply of money in the Indian market. A higher repo rate helps in reducing the borrowing power of the commercial banks which, in turn, reduces the flow of cash in the market. This method helps to control inflation.
Let us take an example here. Let us assume that the country has been hit by inflation and the RBI has set the repo rate at 10%. In this case, if a commercial bank is borrowing an amount of Rs.10,000 from the central bank, the interest amount for the same will be Rs.1,000. To avoid paying this higher rate of interest, the commercial banks decide to not borrow further from the RBI which reduces the supply of cash in the market. As the flow of cash reduces in the market, the demand is not met. This helps in checking the inflation and regulating it accordingly.
- What is repo rate?
Repurchase Agreement or Repurchasing Option is referred to as ""repo."" The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) uses the repo rate as an interest rate,when lending money to commercial banks to control inflation rates.
- What is reverse repo rate?
The interest rate that the central bank offers to commercial banks that deposit money in the RBI treasury is known as the reverse repo rate.
- What is the difference between repo rate and reverse repo rate?
The RBI charges a repo rate on the money it lends to commercial banks and other financial institutions while the interest rate that the central bank offers to commercial banks that deposit money in the RBI is the reverse repo rate.Reverse repo rate is never greater than repo rate.Repo rates assist in reducing market inflation.On the other hand,the reverse repo rate aids in regulating the amount of money available in the market.
- What is Marginal Cost of Funds Based Lending Rate?
The Marginal Cost of Funds Based Lending Rate, also known as MCLR,is a benchmark rate that banks use internally to determine the maximum interest rate they can charge borrowers.
- What types of loans are impacted by the reduction or increase in repo rates?
A reduction or increase in the repo rate will affect loans like personal,vehicle,home,and gold loans.
- How frequently will banks alter loan interest rates that are tied to the repo rate?
Guidelines established by the Reserve Bank of India state that interest rates based on an external benchmark interest rate must be revised every 3 months.
RBI Hikes Repo Rate to 6.5%
The Reserve Bank of India's (RBI) Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) announced an increase in the repo rate by 25 basis points to 6.5% on 8 February, as revealed by Governor Shaktikanta Das. The Governor stated that the global economy has improved and inflation is decreasing. He added that the MPC decided with a 4:2 vote to continue with the withdrawal of the accommodative policy. The real GDP growth for 2023-24 is estimated at 6.4%, and the Indian economy remains resilient, despite global uncertainty, Das stated. Retail inflation is predicted to reach an average of 5.6% in the fourth quarter, and the CPI inflation for 2022-23 is projected at 6.5%, according to Das. To curb inflation, primarily caused by external factors such as the Russia-Ukraine conflict, the Reserve Bank of India has increased the short-term lending rate by 250 basis points since May of last year.

Repo rates hiked by RBI by 50 basis points
The Reserve Bank of India Governor Shaktikanta Das,while announcing the decisions of the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC), said that the prime lending rate or repo rate has been increased by 50 basis points to 5.90 per cent.This has been done four times since May.The latest repo revision is made due to current inflation levels.
30 Sept 2022
RBI increases the repo rate to 5.4%
The repo rate has been increased by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) by 50 basis points (bps). Following the hike, the policy rate is similar to what the rate was in late 2019. Post the hike made by the Monetary Policy Committee, the new repo rate is 5.4%. The central bank considers the repo rate before providing banks with any short-term funds.
05 August 2022
RBI has increased repo rate by 50 bps
On 8 June, the Reserve Bank of India's monetary policy committee (MPC) raised the repo rate by 50 basis points extending the fight against rising inflation. The repo rate is now at 4.9%. Inflation is expected to be 6.7%, according to the MPC. Retail inflation rose to a near-eight-year high of 7.79% in April, up from 6.95% in March, according to data released on 12 May.

The Farmington River is a river, 46.7 miles (75.2 km) [1] in length along its main stem, located in northwest Connecticut with major tributaries extending into southwest Massachusetts . The longest route of the river, from the origin of its West Branch, is 80.4 miles (129.4 km) long, making it the Connecticut River 's longest tributary by 2.3 miles (3.7 km) over the major river directly to its north, the Westfield River . [1] The Farmington River's watershed covers 609 square miles (1,580 km 2 ). Historically, the river played an important role in small-scale manufacturing in towns along its course, but it is now mainly used for recreation and drinking water.
Headwaters for the two branches of the Farmington River, the East Branch and West Branch, are found in southwestern Massachusetts, though only the West Branch officially begins north of the Connecticut border. The West Branch begins at the outlet of Hayden Pond in Otis, Massachusetts . The East Branch begins in Hartland , Connecticut at the confluence of Pond, Hubbard and Valley Brooks. [2] However, this branch has been impounded along the first 11 miles of its course to form the Barkhamsted Reservoir and Lake McDonough; it does not assume a river-like appearance until it exits Lake McDonough in New Hartford , Connecticut. The East Branch and West Branch join in New Hartford , Connecticut, one mile south of the lake. Upper reaches of the river generally flow southward, but the river turns northward in Farmington, Connecticut , and runs mostly north and east until it flows into the Connecticut River in Windsor .
Sites built adjacent to the river by nomadic peoples at the end of the last Ice Age , c. 12,400 years BP of the Younger Dryas indicate the presence of the earliest peoples to populate the region that would become known as southern New England . In the winter of 2019, the remains of the site were excavated in Avon , along with stone tools and artifacts constructed from materials in neighboring regions. [3]
The upper Connecticut and Farmington River valleys were the lands of the Native American indigenous people called the Massaco , a sub-tribe of the Tunxis , who were affiliated with the Wappinger . The name Tunxis, a word in the Quiripi family of Eastern Algonquian languages , derives from the indigenous term Wuttunkshau for ""the point where the river bends"". Halfway through the course of the river, in a floodplain in the town of Farmington at the base of the Metacomet Ridge , the flow of the Farmington River changes its direction to the northeast, where it eventually joins up with the Connecticut River in Windsor . [4]
When Europeans first arrived, the ""Tunxis Sepus"" territory consisted of a 165-mile square area bounded by Simsbury to the North, Wallingford to the South, to the northwest by Mohawk country, and on the east by the current towns of Windsor, Hartford and Wethersfield. In 1645, the Town of Farmington, Connecticut was named by the Connecticut General Assembly, and this was re-affirmed in 1650 by the execution of a deed by the General Assembly and the reservation of land for the ""Tunxis Indians"" near ""Indian Neck"" on the east bank of the Farmington River. [5] A group of twenty wigwams existed in Farmington at the beginning of the eighteenth century, but only four or five families resided in the settlement by 1761 [5]
The land of the Massaco was subsequently purchased by the Dutch. This and its settlement during the era of the Connecticut Colony are described in the early history of Simsbury .
The Spoonville Dam, built on the Farmington River in 1899 below the Tariffville Gorge in East Granby , was breached in the Flood of 1955 and remained as a partial dam for several decades before being removed in July 2012. [6] The dam, as well as the bridge crossing the Farmington River downstream at Route 187 , derived its name from the silver plating factory erected in 1840 on the north bank of the river. It was the first factory of its kind in the United States. [7]
Several bridges constructed in the 19th century and early 20th century still span the Farmington River to this day. Among these are:
- Farmington River Railroad Bridge, a stone arch bridge in Windsor, Connecticut built in 1867 [8]
- Drake Hill Road Bridge , a Parker through-truss bridge in Simsbury, Connecticut constructed in 1892 [9]
- Town Bridge, a Parker through-truss bridge in Canton, Connecticut constructed by the Berlin Iron Bridge Company in 1895 [10]
- Richards Corner Bridge, a Pratt through-truss bridge in New Hartford, Connecticut built in 1930 which spans the East Branch Farmington River [11]
- Pleasant Valley Bridge, a Parker through-truss bridge in Barkhamsted, Connecticut built in 1939 [12]
- Unionville Bridge, a Warren through-truss bridge in Unionville, Connecticut built in 1939 [13]
The river has several whitewater sections that are popular for tubing and kayaking. [14] [15] One of these, the colloquial ""Upper Farmington"" section of the West Branch in New Boston, Massachusetts , is about 7 miles (11 km) long. It is Class 2 through farm and woods scenery to an iron bridge, where kayak and canoe slalom races are held. Below the bridge the river becomes Class 3-4, [ citation needed ] with a short gorge with several abrupt drops.
The biggest of these is about four feet at Decoration Rock. Below, the river continues fast and technical with many rocks and constant maneuvering required. The river is continuously rapid, leading through larger drops at Battering Ram rapid and Corkscrew. Eventually the river flattens to Class 2 until a final, ledge rapid at Bear's Den, just above the reservoir. The Upper Farmington is barely runnable (very scratchy with many exposed rocks and pinning possibilities) during fall dam releases, and is a much better run at levels of about 600 cubic feet per second (16,990 L/s), or about 5 feet (1.5 m) on the internet gauge for that section. A second whitewater section is found in Tariffville, Connecticut , one mile (1.6 km) of technical Class 3 water which is runnable all year round. The river is normally paddled at levels between 1.5 and 2.75 feet (45–75 cm) on the internet gauge; [16] above 2.5 feet (75 cm) it becomes significantly heavier and more dangerous. This section includes the famous T-ville Hole, where kayakers can practice hole surfing and freestyle moves above a flat pool. Below the Hole is a broken dam, where the river funnels through an abrupt four foot drop into a large wave. This area is popular with swimmers in summer, and it is risky due to heavy currents and undercut rocks.
There have been at least three fatal drownings in the Tariffville Gorge section, primarily people who were not properly prepared or trained for the heavy rapids and pinning obstacles in the gorge. Paddlers without helmets, lifejackets and Class 3 whitewater skills should end downriver trips at Tariffville Park, just above the start of the gorge.
Other whitewater areas include Satan's Kingdom in New Hartford, Connecticut, which is popular with tubers, and the Crystal Rapids section in Collinsville and Unionville, Connecticut, which is about four miles (6 km) of Class 1-3 training waters with a bicycle and pedestrian path on the right side of the river. Entrance to the park is free. A service will also pick tubers up and drop them off at certain points.
The west branch of the river includes two hydroelectric dams in West Hartland and Colebrook, run by the Metropolitan District Commission of Connecticut .
The largest dam on the east branch is the Saville Dam , which impounds the Barkhamsted Reservoir .
The Rainbow Dam, a 68-foot (21 m) dam with a hydroelectric generator and a fish ladder , dams the river at Windsor, a few miles before the river flows into the Connecticut River.
A number of other dams have been built on the river since European settlement, usually to power mills and other industry. A few, such as in Collinsville, are still mostly intact. The Collinsville Renewable Energy Promotion Act (H.R. 316;113th Congress) would instruct the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to issue licenses to the town of Canton, Connecticut , to restart two small power dams along the river. [17] The bill passed the United States House of Representatives on February 12, 2013, but has not yet become law.
Water released from or flowing over the Otis Reservoir dam enters the Farmington River just north of Reservoir Road in Otis, Massachusetts. Significant quantities of water are released during the fall in order to drop the reservoir water level for the winter.
Much of the Farmington River has been designated as part of the United States National Wild & Scenic Rivers System . The first such designation on the river was bestowed in 1994 and included 14 miles of water, mostly along the Farmington River West Branch but also a section of the river's main stem, from Hartland to the New Hartford - Canton town line. In 2019, this designation was extended 1.1 miles further downstream to the confluence with the Nepaug River . [18] Most of the Farmington River main stem and the Salmon Brook tributary system, totalling 61.7 miles of additional water, were also designated Wild & Scenic in 2019. [19] The Farmington River Coordinating Committee oversees the implementation of management plans for the designated runs of the Farmington River and includes representatives from towns along the river, the Connecticut Department of Energy and Environmental Protection , Metropolitan District Commission , National Park Service , Farmington River Watershed Association and Farmington River Anglers Association. [20]
The Farmington River and its tributaries are known to contain 11 species of freshwater mussels . [21] The Farmington has the highest mussel species diversity of any tributary to the Connecticut, lacking only the Yellow lampmussel , which is found only in the mainstem of the Connecticut from Turners Falls, MA downriver to Windsor, CT.

An election can also take place following a vote of no confidence in the government, which would force the government to resign. The FTPA sets a five-yearly interval between general elections and early general elections can take place if two-thirds of all MPs vote for it or after a vote of no confidence. The Act has had mixed results, with the two subsequent Parliaments ending earlier than expected. A review of the Act is to be carried out in 2020. The power to request dissolution is no longer the Prime Minister’s, but the Prime Minister can still initiate and press for an early election.","The Fixed-term Parliaments Act 2011 (FTPA) set in legislation a default fixed election date for a general election to the Westminster parliament, removing the Prime Minister's longstanding power to call an election before the end of the five-year term.","List per year
The Fixed-term Parliaments Act 2011 (c. 14) ( FTPA ) was an Act of the Parliament of the United Kingdom which, for the first time, set in legislation a default fixed election date for general elections in the United Kingdom. It remained in force until 2022, when it was repealed. Since then, as before its passage, elections are required by law to be held at least once every five years, but can be called earlier if the prime minister advises the monarch to exercise the royal prerogative to do so. Prime ministers have often employed this mechanism to call an election before the end of their five-year term, sometimes fairly early in it, and critics have claimed this gives an unfair advantage to the incumbent prime minister; allowing them to call a general election at a time that suits them electorially. While it was in force, the FTPA removed this longstanding power of the prime minister . [1] [2]
Under the FTPA, the next general election was automatically scheduled for the first Thursday in May of the fifth year after the previous general election, or the fourth year if the date of the previous election was before the first Thursday in May. However, the FTPA also provided two ways to call an election earlier. One was a Commons vote of no confidence in the government, which still required only a simple majority of voters. The other was a vote explicitly in favour of an earlier election, which required a qualified majority of two-thirds of the total membership of the Commons. [3] The first election under the FTPA was held on 7 May 2015. An early election was held in 2017 , after Prime Minister Theresa May received approval to call it by a two-thirds majority. [4]
Under the FTPA, the next general election was scheduled for 2022, but the Early Parliamentary General Election Act 2019 , passed with Opposition support, circumvented the FTPA, providing for an election on 12 December 2019 while otherwise leaving the FTPA in place. After winning the election, the Conservative Party committed to repealing the FTPA. [5] In fulfilment of this manifesto pledge, the government published on 1 December 2020 a draft Fixed-term Parliaments Act 2011 (Repeal) Bill that would repeal the FTPA and revive the royal prerogative power of dissolving Parliament as it existed before the Act. [6] The legislation was formally announced as the Dissolution and Calling of Parliament Bill in the Queen's Speech of 11 May 2021, and granted Royal Assent on 24 March 2022. [7]
The Parliament of England originated as a board of advisors for the monarch, or curia regis . As the king was able to summon Parliament at will, so could he dissolve it by royal proclamation . [8] Events of the 17th century began to regulate the summoning and dissolution of Parliament; the English Civil War was in large part caused by the efforts of Charles I to rule without it. The Triennial Act of 1641 was passed to require Parliament meet for at least one session every three years, providing for a failsafe mechanism should the king fail to issue the appropriate writs; this was replaced by the Meeting of Parliament Act 1694 , requiring annual sessions and a general election at least every three years. The Septennial Act 1715 increased the maximum lifespan of a parliament to seven years. The Chartists demanded annual parliamentary elections, which was the only demand of theirs that was not achieved by the end of the 19th century. The Parliament Act 1911 amended the Septennial Act by reducing the lifespan to five years. [9] These laws can be, and have been, abrogated in times of great crisis, in practice during both World Wars, whose respective parliaments lasted from 1910 to 1918 and from 1935 to 1945 .
Despite these regulations, the royal prerogative to dissolve Parliament within the bounds of law remained. Events of the 18th and 19th century reduced the monarch's personal power in politics in favour of that of his nominal advisor the prime minister , such that by the 19th century prime ministers had a great deal of de facto control over the timing of general elections. The death of a monarch automatically dissolved Parliament – being as it was technically at the monarch's service – and caused a general election prior to 1867. [ citation needed ] The handing of such power to the prime minister was a convention rather than any formal law, and the monarch could (and, since the repeal of the FTPA, can) in theory refuse to grant such a request; the Lascelles Principles developed in the 1950s outline the possible scenarios where such refusal would likely be granted.
The statutory lifespan referred to the lifetime of the parliament and not to the interval between general elections. For example, while John Major's government lasted four years, eleven months and two days; the period between the general elections of 1992 and 1997 was five years and twenty-two days. [9] No parliament in practice ever reached this milestone outside of the World Wars, as it was always dissolved before its expiry. [10] The longest Parliament preceding the FTPA, other than during wartime, was the 51st Parliament (1992–1997), which lasted four years, eleven months and two days. [11]
The lack of a fixed parliamentary term allowed for the prime minister to decide when to hold an election solely on partisan grounds; it was also criticised for creating uncertatinty before the calling of an election when such a calling was anticipated. [12] It was also presumed easier to cut short a Parliament and hold an early election in order to resolve political difficulties or remove instability, but the outcome of the early election would not necessarily make those objectives easier to achieve. [ citation needed ]
Until 2010 the Conservative Party 's manifesto made no mention of fixed-term Parliaments. The Labour Party manifesto for 2010 said that it would introduce fixed-term Parliaments, but did not say how long they would be. The Liberal Democrat manifesto for 2010 included a pledge to introduce four-year fixed-term Parliaments. The 2010 election resulted in a hung Parliament , with the Conservatives having 306 MPs and the Liberal Democrats 57 MPs. The two parties negotiated a coalition agreement to form a government, and a commitment to legislate for fixed-term Parliaments was included in the coalition deal. [12] The journalist John Rentoul has suggested that one of the subsequent coalition government's motives for passing the legislation was a concern about its own potential instability. In this view the legislation was intended to make it difficult for either coalition partner to force an early election and bring the government down. [13]
Section 3(1) [14] of the Act originally stated [15] that Parliament should be automatically dissolved seventeen working days before the polling day of a general election . This was subsequently amended by the Electoral Registration and Administration Act 2013 to twenty-five working days. Section 1 of the FTPA provided for the polling day to occur on the first Thursday in May of the fifth year after the previous general election, starting with 7 May 2015. [ citation needed ]
The Prime Minister was given the power to postpone this date by up to two months by laying a draft statutory instrument before the House proposing that polling day occur up to two months later than that date. If the use of such a statutory instrument were approved by each House of Parliament, the Prime Minister had the power, by order made by statutory instrument under section 1(5), to provide that polling day occurs accordingly. [ citation needed ]
Section 2 of the FTPA also provided for two ways in which a general election could be held before the end of this five-year period: [16]
- If the House of Commons resolved ""That this House has no confidence in Her Majesty's Government"" (a motion of no confidence ), an early general election would be held, unless the House of Commons subsequently resolved ""That this House has confidence in Her Majesty's Government"". This second resolution must be made within fourteen days of the first. This provision recognised that in a hung parliament it might be possible for a new government to be formed, commanding a majority.
- If the House of Commons, with the support of two-thirds of its total membership (including vacant seats), resolved ""That there shall be an early parliamentary general election"".
In either of these two cases, the Monarch (on the recommendation of the Prime Minister) appointed the date of the new election by proclamation. Parliament was then dissolved 25 working days before that date. [ citation needed ]
Apart from the automatic dissolution in anticipation of a general election, whether held early or not, section 3(2) provided that ""Parliament cannot otherwise be dissolved"". The FTPA thus removed the traditional royal prerogative to dissolve Parliament , [17] and repealed the Septennial Act 1715 as well as references in other Acts to the royal prerogative. The royal prerogative to prorogue Parliament – that is, to end a parliamentary session – was not affected by the FTPA. [18]
Under section 7(4)–(6) of the FTPA the Prime Minister was obliged to establish a committee to review the operation of the FTPA and to make recommendations for its amendment or repeal, if appropriate. The committee was required to be established between 1 June and 30 November 2020, and the majority of its members must be members of the House of Commons. On 10 November 2020, the House of Commons ordered the establishment of a Joint Committee pursurant to the FTPA and appointed the Commons members of the Committee. [19]
When introducing the Bill that became the FTPA into the House of Commons, Nick Clegg , then Deputy Prime Minister and Leader of the Liberal Democrats , said that ""by setting the date that Parliament will [be] dissolve[d], our Prime Minister is giving up the right to pick and choose the date of the next general election—that's a true first in British politics."" [20]
The government initially indicated that an ""enhanced majority"" of 55 per cent of MPs would be needed to trigger a dissolution, but this did not become part of the FTPA. Instead, the FTPA contains the two-thirds requirement. [21]
Proposed amendments that would have limited the fixed term to four years, backed by Labour , Plaid Cymru and the SNP , were defeated. [22]
Section 4 of the FTPA postponed the Scottish Parliament election that would have been held on 7 May 2015, moving the election day to 5 May 2016 to avoid it coinciding with the general election in the United Kingdom. [23]
Robert Blackburn QC, a professor of constitutional law, stated that ""the status and effect of a no-confidence motion remains largely as it was prior to the Act"". [24] Alastair Meeks, however, a lawyer writing on the PoliticalBetting.com website, argued that, as well as removing the Prime Minister's ability to set an election date at a time of their choosing, the FTPA significantly affected the British constitution . It removed the ability of the Prime Minister to make a vote on a policy a matter of confidence in the government, a tool that minority governments and governments with small majorities have used to ensure that legislation is passed in the House of Commons. This put such governments at risk of remaining in power without an adequate ability to legislate, increasing the necessity of coalition government. [3]
David Allen Green , a lawyer and journalist, and Andrew Blick, a legal academic, argued that the FTPA changed little in practice, since the Prime Minister could still, so long as at least a portion of the Opposition agrees, schedule an election at their pleasure . [25] [26] Blick also argued that the use of a supermajority requirement for the House of Commons , which is very rare in UK law, represented a move towards entrenched clauses in the UK Constitution. [27]
In 2017 Blick argued alongside Graham Allen , who chaired the House of Commons Select Committee on Political and Constitutional Reform during passage of the FTPA, that the FTPA had failed ""to deliver on one of its main stated purposes ... to reduce the discretion possessed by the Prime Minister in being able to determine the date of general elections"". Allen and Blick argued, however, that this was an ""admirable objective"" and proposed that instead of being repealed the FTPA should be amended to provide additional safeguards. [28]
During the passage of the FTPA, Graham Allen stated on second reading that his committee had not received ample notice for adequate scrutiny of the Bill and that there were ""so many flaws in the Bill's drafting"". [29] It was also reported that Allen was critical that the committee had not had sufficient time to consider whether a four-year term would have been more appropriate than the five-year term stipulated in the FTPA. [30] While he was still Chair of the Select Committee on Political and Constitutional Reform [31] Allen wrote an essay in favour of codifying all the prerogative powers, and referred to his experience in challenging the prerogative powers of war. [32]
According to one political scientist, Colin Talbot , the FTPA made minority governments more stable than in the past, since events that previously might have forced a government out of power—such as defeat of a Queen's Speech or other important legislation, loss of supply , or a vote of no confidence in the Prime Minister rather than the government as a whole—cannot formally do so. [33]
Lord Norton , a Conservative political scientist, argued that the FTPA significantly limited the Prime Minister's ability to obtain an early election, since the Opposition could prevent an election by voting against it. [34] This was borne out in 2019, as the Opposition blocked Prime Minister Boris Johnson 's attempt to hold early elections on several occasions. [35] An Act of Parliament for an early election (the Early Parliamentary General Election Act 2019 ) was then passed, with Opposition support, by a simple majority. [ citation needed ]
In September 2019 Junade Ali advised in written evidence to the House of Lords Constitution Committee that repeal of the FTPA should be pursued on the basis that, as A. V. Dicey noted, dissolution allows for the executive to appeal to the nation if it feels the House of Commons is no longer supported by the electors, allowing for the resolution of unforeseen constitutional crises by the electorate. [36] Ali argued that ""The very legislative chamber subject to dissolution being, in all circumstances, required to consent to such dissolution removes essential oversight in a sovereign Parliament that can make or unmake any law whatsoever"". [37] Ali reiterated his argument that even if the FTPA had codified prorogation powers, the executive could instead seek refusal of Royal Assent until an early election was called, which, Ali argues, ""would likely cause far greater constitutional outrage"" and codification would ""threaten to transform political into constitutional crises"" [38] This view was supported in a submission by Robert Craig, who stated: ""The main justification for the Act appears to reside in an erroneous view that the political power to call an election is inappropriate in a political constitution."" [39]
A cross-party parliamentary Joint Committee on the Fixed-Term Parliaments Act, including 14 members of the Commons and 6 peers, was established on 27 November 2020 to review the operation of the Act and make recommendations as to its repeal or amendment. [40] Its report, published on 24 March 2021, concluded that the Act was flawed in several respects: the supermajority requirement imposed by the Act, the committee argued, risks ""parliamentary gridlock"" and ""lacks credibility"", as shown by the special legislation passed to circumvent the Act in 2019; the Act unduly circumscribed the powers of the Leader of the Opposition to bring forward motions of no confidence and of the government to declare issues to be matters of confidence; finally, the Act's definition of the 14-day period following successful motions of no confidence was unsatisfactory and may have allowed a government to force an election even in cases where an alternative government could be formed from the existing Parliament. [41] The chair of the committee, Conservative Lord McLoughlin , described the FTPA as ""likely to be a short-lived constitutional experiment"". [42]
The 2015 general election held on 7 May 2015 was the only use of the FTPA to dictate the date of a general election. [43]
On 18 April 2017, Prime Minister Theresa May announced her intention to call a general election for 8 June 2017, bringing the United Kingdom's 56th Parliament to an end after two years and 32 days. The FTPA permitted this, but required two-thirds of the Commons (at least 434 MPs) to support the motion to allow it to be passed. [44] Jeremy Corbyn , then the Leader of the Opposition and the Labour Party indicated that he was in support of an election. The motion was passed the following day by 522 votes to 13 votes. [45]
As the FTPA required that general elections take place on the first Thursday in May, the date of the next general election after the 2017 election (assuming that no earlier elections were called) would have been 5 May 2022, meaning that the term would have been one month short of five years. [ citation needed ]
On 17 December 2018, the Labour Party tabled a motion of no confidence in the Prime Minister, Theresa May . As this was not a motion of no confidence in Her Majesty's Government in the form set out in the FTPA, its passing would not have resulted in a general election being called. Arguing that this would have no effect because of the FTPA, May was able to call it a stunt and deny it any time for debate. [46]
The SNP , the Liberal Democrats , Plaid Cymru and the Green Party submitted an amendment to the motion that, if passed, would have changed the motion to meet the requirements of the FTPA. The government subsequently announced that the motion would not be given parliamentary time. [ citation needed ]
The following day, 18 December 2018, the SNP, the Liberal Democrats, Plaid Cymru and the Green Party tabled a new motion of no confidence in the Government in the form set down in the FTPA. This was the first such motion to be tabled under the terms of the FTPA. [47]
Boris Johnson's government attempted three times to call an early general election by means of section 2(2) of the FTPA. Each motion achieved a simple majority, but did not meet the two-thirds requirement because opposition parties abstained. Eventually Parliament passed the Early Parliamentary General Election Act 2019 . [ citation needed ]
On 3 September 2019, the government tabled a motion under the FTPA to trigger an early general election, requiring the votes of two-thirds of MPs. However, Labour refused to support the motion until legislation to delay a no-deal Brexit had been passed. [52] On 4 September, there were 298 votes for the motion and 56 against, with 288 abstentions, well short of the two-thirds supermajority required. [35] On 6 September, four opposition parties – Labour, the Liberal Democrats, the SNP and Plaid Cymru – agreed not to support any parliamentary vote for a general election until after the next meeting of the European Council , which was scheduled for 17–18 October 2019. [53]
On 9 September, another motion for an early election was tabled by the government. It failed by 293 votes to 46, with 303 abstentions [54] [55] [56] [57]
Parliament was prorogued on the same day, until 14 October. [58] The prorogation was later deemed unlawful by the Supreme Court and proceedings were resumed on 25 September. [59] [60] [61]
On 24 October 2019, Prime Minister Boris Johnson announced his intention to call a general election via a motion under the FTPA to be tabled on 28 October. [62] Jeremy Corbyn , then Leader of the Opposition, indicated that he would support an election only if Johnson pledged to take a no-deal Brexit off the table. [63] On 28 October, the motion failed despite a vote of 299 to 70 because mass abstentions by the opposition prevented the forming of the two-thirds majority required under the FTPA. [64] [65]
No further motions under the FTPA were attempted in the 2017–19 Parliament, as Prime Minister Boris Johnson introduced the Early Parliamentary General Election Act 2019 to the House of Commons on the same day, which triggered an election after it was passed.
The Early Parliamentary General Election Act 2019 was introduced on 29 October 2019 by Boris Johnson [66] following the failure to secure an election by a two-thirds majority the previous day. The Bill was fast-tracked through the House of Commons on the same day it was introduced, [67] the following day Baroness Evans of Bowes Park ( Leader of the House of Lords ) introduced the Bill in the House of Lords and it received its First Reading. The Bill completed all stages the following day (30 October) without amendment and was presented to the Queen for Royal Assent . In accordance with the Royal Assent Act 1967 , at 4:27 PM on 31 October, Royal Assent was notified to the House of Lords and notified in the House of Commons at 4:35 PM. [68] The Bill became law within three days from introduction to Royal Assent, an uncommonly short time. [69] [70]
The Act circumvented the FTPA to provide for a general election on 12 December:
At 12:01 AM on 6 November, Parliament was dissolved, as the FTPA required that dissolution must happen 25 days before a general election with all seats in the House of Commons becoming vacant. [72]
The 2019 act referred to the FTPA but did not amend it. The FTPA remained in force unaltered until its repeal in 2022; the effect of the 2019 act was only to interrupt its operation. The two acts did not legally conflict, owing to the British constitutional principle of Parliamentary sovereignty , that Parliament has ""the right to make or unmake any law whatever"", and constitutional laws are of no different status. [73] [74]
In 2016, in the wake of the Panama Papers scandal, a petition was created on the Parliament petitions website that called for a general election after former British Prime Minister David Cameron revealed that he had had investments in an offshore trust. [75] After the petition had passed the threshold of 100,000 signatures, the government response cited the Fixed-term Parliaments Act in its reply, and stated that ""no Government can call an early general election any more anyway"". [76]
In 2017, the journalist John Rentoul writing in The Independent newspaper argued that the Fixed-term Parliaments Act indirectly caused the election loss of Theresa May 's majority in the 2017 election. Technicalities made her choose an election campaign of seven weeks, 2–3 weeks longer than usual, which, Rentoul argued, lost her the majority. [13]
Losing the parliamentary vote that follows a speech from the throne (also known as a King's or Queen's Speech) has traditionally been seen as having the same consequences for a government as losing a vote of no confidence. Although this was not the case under the Act, the consequences of losing a vote on the Queen's speech were still considered significant. Theresa May delayed the Queen's speech that was expected in spring 2019, partly as a result of concerns about the prospects for winning a parliamentary vote on it. [77]
The Conservative Party manifesto at the 2017 general election proposed repealing the Fixed-term Parliaments Act 2011. [78] However, Theresa May's government failed to win a House of Commons majority at that election and did not attempt to repeal the act. [79] The Conservative Party reiterated the commitment to repeal the act in its manifesto for the December 2019 election , at which it won a majority. The manifesto stated that the Act ""has led to paralysis at a time the country needed decisive action"". [5] [80] The first Queen's Speech following the election confirmed that ""work will be taken forward to repeal the Fixed-term Parliaments Act"". [81]
Lord Norton of Louth commented that repealing the Act would require a new Act of Parliament , and that if the duration of parliaments was to be limited, arrangements for this would need to be included in the new Act because the Fixed-term Parliaments Act 2011 had repealed pre-existing legislation governing the duration of parliaments. [17]
After the December 2019 election, on 3 February 2020, a private member's bill to repeal and replace the FTPA was introduced in the House of Lords by Conservative peer Lord Mancroft . The bill would have established five-year parliaments, the next election to be on 2 May 2024, unless an early election is called by royal proclamation dissolving Parliament. This would have substantially restored the position before the FTPA. Additionally, the bill would have confirmed that the monarch has power to prorogue Parliament until a time of the monarch's choosing. Under the bill, the monarch's actions, and government advice to the monarch about those actions, would not have been justiciable. A second reading was not scheduled for the bill, which failed with the prorogation of Parliament on 29 April 2021. [82]
Since the Act abolished the old prerogative powers, for example the royal power of dissolution, some legal experts such as Raphael Hogarth argued that it would not be possible simply to revive them even if that were desired. The Act might instead have been reformed, in particular to specify what steps should occur during what has been called the ""messy fortnight"" after a motion under the Act is passed and to clarify whether pre-existing types of vote amounting to no confidence, such as rejection of the Budget, continued to require a government's resignation. [83]
This position was rejected in 2020 by the government, which opted to explicitly revive the royal prerogative in its draft legislation repealing the Act. [84] Whether this would in fact constitute a restoration of the prerogative or the creation of a new statutory power is debated by legal experts, with former Supreme Court judges Baroness Hale and Lord Sumption arguing that the prerogative could be revived, constitutional law professor Anne Twomey that it could not, and Stephen Laws , a former First Parliamentary Counsel , stating that ""if Parliament wants the power to be the same as it was before 2011, then it is the duty of the courts to see it as such"". [85]
The government published on 1 December 2020, for consideration by the parliamentary Joint Committee on the FTPA, a draft Fixed-term Parliaments Act 2011 (Repeal) Bill which would repeal and replace the FTPA. [6] The draft, accompanied by a statement of the underlying principles, provides for revival of the royal prerogative powers as to dissolution of parliament and summoning of a new parliament ""as if the Fixed-term Parliaments Act 2011 had never been enacted"", with the effect of restoring maximum five-year parliaments. It adds (which is new) that a court ""may not question"" (a) the ""exercise or purported exercise"" of those powers, (b) ""any decision or purported decision relating to those powers"" or (c) ""the limits or extent of those powers"". [84] Retitled the Dissolution and Calling of Parliament Bill, it was announced formally in the Queen's Speech of 11 May 2021 and introduced to Parliament the following day. [86] [87] The Dissolution and Calling of Parliament Act was granted royal assent on 24 March 2022, repealing the Fixed Term Parliaments Act and the Early Parliamentary General Election Act 2019 as part of the act's provisions.

United Nations Specialized Agencies are autonomous organizations working with the United Nations and each other through the co-ordinating machinery of the United Nations Economic and Social Council at the intergovernmental level, and through the Chief Executives Board for co-ordination (CEB) at the inter-secretariat level. [1] [2] [3]
One of the principal objectives of the U.N. is to solve economic, social, cultural and humanitarian problems through international cooperation. Several specialized agencies have been set up to achieve these goals, agencies which may or may not have been created by the United Nations, but they are incorporated into the United Nations System by the United Nations Economic and Social Council acting under Articles 57 and 63 of the United Nations Charter . At present, the U.N. has in total 15 [4] [5] [note 1] specialized agencies that carry out various functions on behalf of the UN. The specialized agencies are listed below. [8] [9]
The Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations leads international efforts to defeat hunger. Serving both developed and developing countries, FAO acts as a neutral forum where all nations meet as equals to negotiate agreements and debate policy. FAO's mandate is to raise levels of nutrition, improve agricultural productivity , better the lives of rural populations and contribute to the growth of the world economy. FAO is the largest of the U.N. agencies. It was established in 1945 and its headquarters is in Rome , Italy.
The International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) was founded in 1947. It codifies the principles and techniques of international air navigation and fosters the planning and development of international air transport to ensure safe and orderly growth. Its headquarters are located in the Quartier international de Montréal of Montreal , Quebec.
The ICAO Council adopts standards and recommended practices concerning air navigation, prevention of unlawful interference, and facilitation of border-crossing procedures for international civil aviation . In addition, ICAO defines the protocols for air accident investigation followed by transport safety authorities in countries signatory to the Convention on International Civil Aviation , commonly known as the Chicago Convention .
The International Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD) was established as an international financial institution in 1977, as one of the major outcomes of the 1974 World Food Conference and a response to the situation in the Sahel . It is dedicated to eradicating rural poverty in developing countries. Its headquarters are in Rome , Italy .
The International Labour Organization (ILO) deals with labour issues. Its headquarters are in Geneva , Switzerland . Founded in 1919, it was formed through the negotiations of the Treaty of Versailles and was initially an agency of the League of Nations. It became a member of the UN system after the demise of the League and the formation of the UN at the end of World War II. Its Constitution , as amended to date, includes the Declaration of Philadelphia on the aims and purposes of the Organization. Its secretariat is known as the International Labour Office.
The International Maritime Organization (IMO), formerly known as the Inter-Governmental Maritime Consultative Organization (IMCO), was established in 1948 by the United Nations to coordinate international maritime safety and related practices. However, the IMO did not enter into full force until 1958.
Headquartered in London , United Kingdom, IMO promotes cooperation between government and the shipping industry to improve maritime safety and prevent marine pollution . IMO is governed by an Assembly of members and is financially administered by a council of members elected from the assembly. The work of IMO is conducted through five committees, and these are supported by technical sub-committees. Member organizations of the U.N. organizational family may observe the proceedings of the IMO. Observer status may be granted to qualified non-governmental organizations.
The IMO is supported by a permanent secretariat of employees who are representative of its members. The secretariat is composed of a Secretary-General who is periodically elected by the Assembly, and various divisions including, inter alia , marine safety, environmental protection, and a conference section. It also promotes international cooperation in education, science and culture.
The International Monetary Fund (IMF) is part of the United Nations system and has a formal relationship agreement with the U.N., but retains its independence. [10] The IMF provides monetary cooperation and financial stability and acts as a forum for advice, negotiation and assistance on financial issues. It is headquartered in Washington D.C. .
The International Telecommunication Union (ITU) was established to standardize and regulate international radio and telecommunications . It was founded as the International Telegraph Union in Paris on 17 May 1865. Its main tasks include standardization , allocation of the radio spectrum, and organizing interconnection arrangements between different countries to allow international phone calls — in which regard it performs for telecommunications a similar function to what the Universal Postal Union (UPU) performs for postal services. It has its headquarters in Geneva , Switzerland, next to the U.N.'s Geneva campus.
Main article: UNESCO
The United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization ( UNESCO ) is a specialized agency of the United Nations established in 1945 with its headquarters in Paris , France . Its stated purpose is to contribute to peace and security by promoting international collaboration through education, science, and culture to propagate further universal respect for justice, the rule of law , and the human rights and fundamental freedoms proclaimed in the U.N. Charter.
The United Nations Industrial Development Organization (UNIDO) is the specialized agency of the United Nations, which promotes inclusive and sustainable industrial development (ISID), headquartered in Vienna , Austria. The organization addresses some of the most pressing issues of our time and works to accelerate economic growth to bring prosperity to all while at the same time safeguarding the environment. UNIDO's mandate is fully aligned with the global development agenda, which underlines the central role of industrialization and its importance as a key enabler for all 17 Global Goals , and especially for SDG9. The Director General is Gerd Müller .
The Universal Postal Union (UPU), headquartered in Berne , Switzerland, coordinates postal policies between member nations, and hence the worldwide postal system. Each member country agrees to the same set of terms for conducting international postal duties.
The World Bank Group is part of the United Nations System and has a formal relationship agreement with the U.N., but retains its independence. [10] The WBG comprises a group of five legally separate but affiliated institutions: the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (IBRD), the International Finance Corporation (IFC), the International Development Association (IDA), the Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency (MIGA), and the International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes (ICSID). It is a vital source of financial and technical assistance to developing countries around the world. Its mission is to fight poverty with passion and professionalism for lasting results and to help people help themselves and their environment by providing resources, sharing knowledge, building capacity and forging partnerships in the public and private sectors. WBG's headquarters are in Washington, D.C. .
The International Bank for Reconstruction and Development makes loans to developing countries for development programmes with the stated goal of reducing poverty. It is part of the World Bank Group (WBG).
The International Development Association 's mandate is close to that of the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development , with a focus on the poorest countries. It is part of the World Bank Group (WBG).
The International Finance Corporation is the largest multilateral source of loan and equity financing for private sector projects in the developing world. It is part of the World Bank Group (WBG).
The World Health Organization (WHO) acts as a coordinating authority on international public health and deals with health, sanitation, and diseases and sends medical teams to help combat epidemics . Established on 7 April 1948, the agency inherited the mandate and resources of its predecessor, the Health Organization, which had been an agency of the League of Nations. It was established on 7 April 1948 when 26 members of the United Nations ratified its Constitution. 7 April is celebrated as World Health Day every year. The WHO is governed by 194 Member States through the World Health Assembly. Its headquarters is in Geneva , Switzerland .
The World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO) is a specialized agency of the United Nations created in 1967 and headquartered in Geneva , Switzerland . Its purpose is to encourage creative activity and to promote the protection of intellectual property throughout the world. The organization administers several treaties concerning the protection of intellectual property rights.
The World Meteorological Organization (WMO) originated from the International Meteorological Organization (IMO), which was founded in 1873. Established in 1950, WMO became the specialized agency of the United Nations for modern meteorology (weather and climate), operational hydrology and related geophysical sciences. It has its headquarters in Geneva , Switzerland .
The World Tourism Organization (UNWTO or WTO) was established in 1974 in Madrid , Spain, to replace the International Union of Official Tourist Publicity Organizations (IUOTPO). UNWTO has 160 member states and 350 affiliated members representing private organizations, educational institutions, and others. It is headquartered in Madrid, Spain. The World Tourism Organization serves as a forum for tourism policies and acts as a practical source for tourism know-how.
The only U.N. specialized agency to go out of existence is the International Refugee Organization , which existed from 1946 to 1952. In 1952, it was replaced by the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (headquartered in Geneva , Switzerland ), which is a subsidiary organ of the United Nations General Assembly . [11]
There are other intergovernmental organizations that have concluded cooperation agreements with the United Nations. In terms of cooperation structures, some agreements come very close to the relationship agreements concluded under articles 57 and 63 of the U.N. Charter with the specialized agencies, but due to Charter requirements that the agencies deal with ""economic, social, cultural, educational, health, and related fields"", organizations with such agreements are not formally specialized agencies of the United Nations. [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] These organizations are termed Related Organizations by the UN. [18]
The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) established such an agreement with the UN in 1957. The Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) and the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty Organization (CTBTO) also used this model for agreements of their own with the UN. [16] [17] [19]
The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) is an intergovernmental organization for scientific and technical cooperation in the field of nuclear technology. It is headquartered in Vienna, Austria. It seeks to promote the peaceful use of nuclear energy and to inhibit its use for military purposes . The IAEA was set up as an autonomous organization on 29 July 1957. Before this, in 1953, U.S. President Dwight D. Eisenhower envisioned the creation of this international body to control and develop the use of atomic energy, in his "" Atoms for Peace "" speech before the U.N. General Assembly. [20] The organization and its former Director-General, Mohamed ElBaradei , were jointly awarded the Nobel Peace Prize announced on 7 October 2005. As of March 2015, the IAEA's membership is 164 countries. [21]
Due to historical reasons and the political nature of its work, the IAEA is not a specialized agency. Instead, its relationship with the United Nations is governed by a special agreement as well as by its statute that commits the IAEA to report annually to the General Assembly and, when appropriate, to the Security Council.

If your doctor suspects that you have C. difficile infection, a sample of your stool would be tested for the bacterium.
Treatment for antibiotic-associated diarrhea depends on the severity of your signs and symptoms.
If you have mild diarrhea, your symptoms likely will clear up within a few days after your antibiotic treatment ends. In some cases, your doctor may advise you to stop your antibiotic therapy until your diarrhea subsides.
If you develop C. difficile infection, your doctor will likely stop whatever antibiotic you're currently taking, and might prescribe antibiotics specifically targeted to kill the C. difficile bacteria causing your diarrhea. You may also be asked to stop taking stomach-acid-suppressing drugs. For people with this type of infection, diarrhea symptoms may return and require repeated treatment.
To cope with diarrhea:
Drink enough fluids. To counter a mild loss of fluids from diarrhea, drink more water or drinks that contain electrolytes. For a more severe loss, drink fluids that contain water, sugar and salt — such as oral rehydration solution. Try broth or fruit juice that isn't high in sugar. Avoid beverages that are high in sugar or contain alcohol or caffeine, such as coffee, tea and colas, which can worsen your symptoms.
For infants and children with diarrhea, ask your doctor about using an oral rehydration solution, such as Pedialyte, to replenish fluids and electrolytes.
- Avoid certain foods. It's a good idea to avoid dairy as well as fatty and spicy foods while you have diarrhea. You can usually get back to a normal diet soon after your symptoms resolve.
- Ask about anti-diarrheal medications. In some cases of mild antibiotic-associated diarrhea, your doctor may recommend anti-diarrheal medications, such as loperamide (Imodium A-D). But check with your doctor before taking anti-diarrheal medications because they can interfere with your body's ability to eliminate toxins and lead to serious complications. These medications should not be used if you develop C. difficile infection.
People may turn to probiotics — found in foods such as yogurt — with the hope that they can rebalance the healthy bacteria in their digestive tract. But, there's no consensus on whether or not over-the-counter probiotics can help lessen the symptoms of antibiotic-associated diarrhea. Taking probiotics doesn't appear to be harmful, however, unless you have a weakened immune system.
Make an appointment with the doctor who prescribed the antibiotic. Here's some information to help you get ready for your appointment.
Make a list of:
- Your symptoms, including any that may seem unrelated to the reason for which you scheduled the appointment.
- Key personal information, including any major stresses or recent life changes, for example, if you've recently stayed in the hospital or a nursing home.
- Medications, vitamins or supplements you're taking, including doses. If you've recently taken an antibiotic, include the name, dosage and when you stopped taking it.
- Questions to ask your doctor.
For antibiotic-associated diarrhea, some basic questions to ask your doctor include:
- What tests do I need?
- Is my condition likely temporary or chronic?
- What is the best course of action?
- What are the alternatives to the primary approach that you're suggesting?
- Are there restrictions I should follow?
- Are there foods and drinks I should avoid?
Don't hesitate to ask other questions.
Your doctor is likely to ask you a number of questions. Being ready to answer them may allow more time to cover other points you want to address. Your doctor may ask:
- When did your symptoms begin?
- Can you describe your bowel movements? How frequent are they?
- Do you have a history of intestinal problems such as ulcerative colitis, Crohn's disease or other inflammatory bowel disease?
- Have you been around anyone with diarrhea recently?
Continue taking your antibiotics as directed by your doctor.
To cope with diarrhea until your appointment, you can:
- Drink more water and other liquids to replace fluids lost because of diarrhea
- Eat bland foods and avoid spicy or greasy foods that can aggravate diarrhea",source_text/32b37b1f2b1957220687ebb3982c8aadff8de01f286af65c8278af6e590d2a25-neeva_1_0.txt,,no_support,True,clowns - diarrhea - antibiotics - probiotics - coulrophobia - antibiotic - antibioticassociated - subsides - taking - fluids,StanfordCitation,0.51,0.5033333333333333,0.5,0.5,[0.12073244154453278],[0.12073244154453278]

The only guarantees in life are death and taxes. But out of those two, one is infinitely more complex than the other.
In America, that becomes clear every April, a month associated with the cold sweats that routinely come when individuals and families rush to file their taxes on time. It's a stressful process that can involve long hours, finger blisters from calculator mashing, angry phone calls to human resource offices, and expensive checks written to accountants .
Residents in many other countries around the world face similar circumstances. This is because, like in America, most of the world's major economies have a gradual tax system that charges different rates for various income levels. In most cases, those who make the most money pay a higher percentage in taxes compared to lower-income brackets.
But some countries use a completely different tax system, and it's one that some pundits would like to see advance around the world.
- A flat tax is a system where everyone pays the same tax rate, regardless of their income.
- While countries such as Estonia have seen their economies grow since implementing a flax tax rate, there's no actual proof that the tax system is the reason behind the growth.
- Some drawbacks of a flat tax rate system include lack of wealth redistribution, the added burden on middle and lower-income families, and tax rate wars with neighboring countries.

In many nations, governments have chosen to charge residents and businesses a flat tax. In other words, everyone pays the same exact rate. Proponents of flat taxes say that several benefits exist from using this system.
Many of the countries that have shifted to a flat tax were at one time in the Soviet Union. And these countries, for most of the past decade, have seen their economies grow rapidly. In 2004, 10 Eastern European nations used a flat tax : Ukraine taxed its residents 13%, Georgia implemented a 12% tax, and Romania taxed its citizens 16%. and Lithuania taxed its residents 33%.
1
And many of these countries that instituted a flat tax saw their economies grow dramatically.
For example, Estonia, Lithuania, and Latvia were suffering from inefficiency and economic stagnation prior to implementing flat taxes of 26%, 33%, and 26%, respectively—and experienced unprecedented growth following the tax reform, over double what was seen in the world's mature, industrialized economies. Estonia experienced an average growth of 9% each year (adjusted for inflation); Lithuania emerged as the fastest growing economy in the Baltics; and Latvia experienced an average growth rate of about 4% a year since the flat tax, and its inflation, which was 25% in 1995, dropped to less than 4 %.2 a by approximately 8% in a single year.
2
The reason why the flat tax works, according to proponents, is that the system is incredibly simple. In many cases, it's not just individuals who enjoy the benefits of an easy-to-understand tax code ; some nations grant flat taxes to businesses as an incentive to lure corporations and other employers. In addition, there's an inherent sense of fairness to the flat tax, as all people pay the same percentage of their income . This also de-politicizes tax codes as they are written since legislators cannot give preferences or penalties to firms and industries they look upon either favorably or negatively.
Flat tax supporters often cite the nation of Estonia as proof of the system's benefits. Pinned between Russia and the Baltic Sea, Estonia is a tiny country with under two million residents, roughly the size of Dallas, Texas. In 1994, just three years after separating itself from the Soviet Union, Estonian policymakers made the choice to go to a 26% flat tax, the first in the world to move away from the gradual system.
3
That number since then has been reduced to 20%.
4
Since instituting the flat tax, Estonia has emerged from obscurity to become a member of the European Union . And it has also earned the nickname ""The Baltic Tiger"" due to its incredible economic growth rate . From 2000 to 2008, Estonia's economy grew by an average of 7% per year.
5
Though hurt by the global Great Recession, it had rebounded to 4.9% by 2017.
6
In 2011, its unemployment rate was in excess of 13.5%; in 2020, only 6.9% of its population was without jobs. Estonia has also gained a reputation for being surprisingly high-tech; over 89% of its population uses the internet, well above the world average.
7
Other nations followed Estonia's lead and also adopted flat tax policies. First on board were Estonia's two Baltic neighbors, Lithuania and Latvia. Next came Russia, the biggest economy to have adopted this measure. Also following suit were Serbia, Ukraine, Slovakia, Georgia, Romania, Kyrgyzstan, North Macedonia, Mauritius, and Mongolia.
3
First, while there is no doubt that many countries that have adopted the flat tax have had booming economies, there is no actual proof that the flat tax is the reason why these nations have grown. After all, many of these places were Communist nations behind the Iron Curtain. Once the Soviet Union collapsed they were able to open up their economies to investment and had an easier time trading with the developed countries in the west.
In addition, a flat tax may not be as fair as one would think. A gradual tax system does allow for things like wealth redistribution, which many have argued is a major benefit to society. And a flat tax could also give middle-class families an extra burden. If someone making one million per year has to pay 18% of his income in taxes, he still has netted $820,000 for the year, a figure which still has great purchasing power . But a person making $50,000 per year is left with $41,000 per year; that difference can influence fiscal decisions, like purchasing a new car versus a used car, whether to place a down payment on a house or affording either a state school or private college, extremely tough for people who make closer to the national median income level.
In addition, when a group of countries near each other enact a flat tax, it creates a race towards the bottom; in order to compete, nations must keep on lowering their tax rates, a problem that could lead to fiscal instability.
Lastly, in the wake of the 2008 recession , many countries that adopted a flat tax have suffered greatly. Take, for instance, Latvia, one of the earliest countries to adopt the flat tax. Its overheated economy suffered a near-complete liquidity squeeze, which caused its GDP to decline approximately 25% between 2008 and 2010, and unemployment to climb to nearly 21% of the population.
8
It had to take a bailout from the International Monetary Fund in order to pay public sector workers.
The country recovered but decided to ditch the flat tax on personal income in 2017.
9
It now has a progressive system with rates rising from 20% to 31% as a taxpayer's income increases.
10
Latvia's Baltic neighbors, Lithuania and Estonia, also faced similar pitfalls during the global Great Recession. All of this, some say, is a sign that these nations failed to raise enough tax dollars due to their tax policies. Others, however, say that these nations rely on exports, which suffered greatly due to the downturn facing major economies.
So, will the entire world one day have a flat tax? It's unlikely, especially in the world's biggest economies which have a long-established tax code that many might not want to change. But it is likely that, despite recent pitfalls, many smaller and growing nations may see the benefits of charging everyone the same tax.

|Quantum Leap (2022 TV series)|
Quantum Leap is an American science fiction television series, created by Donald P. Bellisario , that premiered on NBC and aired for five seasons, from March 26, 1989, to May 5, 1993. The series stars Scott Bakula as Dr. Sam Beckett , a physicist who involuntarily leaps through spacetime during experiments in time travel , by temporarily taking the place of other people to correct what he consistently discovers were historical mistakes.
Dean Stockwell co-stars as Admiral Al Calavicci , Sam's womanizing, cigar-smoking companion and best friend, who appears to him as a hologram and researches and shapes his opinions of the past.
The series features a mix of humor, drama, romance, social commentary, and science fiction. It was ranked number 19 on TV Guide ' s ""Top Cult Shows Ever"" in 2007. [1] [2]
A revival series was ordered by NBC, which premiered on September 19, 2022.
In the near future, physicist Dr. Sam Beckett ( Scott Bakula ) theorizes that time travel within one's own lifetime is possible, and obtains government support to build his project ""Quantum Leap"". Some years later, having already spent $43 billion, the government threatens to halt funding, as no progress has been made, and Sam decides to test the project accelerator by himself to save the project before anyone can stop him. He is thrown back in time, and on regaining consciousness, finds that while he physically exists in the past, he appears to everyone else as a person into whom he had ""leapt"", and further has partial amnesia related to his own identity. [3] [4] [5] [6]
A hologram of his friend Admiral Al Calavicci ( Dean Stockwell ) appears, visible and audible only to Sam, and helps to explain to Sam that he must correct something that went wrong in the past, aided with the resources of the project's supercomputer Ziggy, the self-aware artificial intelligence "" parallel hybrid computer with an ego."" Despite successfully correcting the past, Sam continues to leap, seemingly ""guided by an unknown force"", to another place and time within his own lifetime, ""putting right what once went wrong and hoping each time that his next leap will be the leap home"". [3] [4] [5] [6]
Sam has six doctoral degrees, a black belt in kung fu , a photographic memory, and near-virtuosic musical talent, allowing him to easily slip into the shoes of many different people. The bookish and naive Sam is a sharp contrast to his best friend Al, a womanizing , cigar -smoking five-time divorcé who grew up in an orphanage , was active in the civil rights movement , and was a prisoner of war in Vietnam .
Sam and Al are the only characters to appear in every episode. The supporting characters of each episode are the friends, family, and acquaintances of the person Sam has leapt into. With a few exceptions such as two-part or sequel episodes, these characters only appear once, though several actors have played multiple characters. Occasionally, Sam will also run into real-life historical figures such as Buddy Holly , Michael Jackson , Donald Trump , Marilyn Monroe , and Ruth Westheimer , the latter of which played herself.
The other members of the Quantum Leap team are mentioned often and each appear in a handful of episodes. They include Irving ""Gooshie"" Gushman ( Dennis Wolfberg ), the project's head programmer , Dr. Verbena Beeks (Candy Ann Brown), the project's psychiatrist , Tina Martinez ( Gigi Rice ), the project's medical technician and Al's lover, and Dr. Donna Eleese ( Teri Hatcher / Mimi Kuzyk ), Sam's wife and the project's director in his absence.
The main premise for Quantum Leap was inspired by such movies as Here Comes Mr. Jordan (1941) and Heaven Can Wait , as well as the 1960s TV show The Time Tunnel . Series creator Donald P. Bellisario [4] [7] saw its concept as a way of developing an original anthology series , as anthologies were unpopular with the networks. [4]
The series ran on NBC [8] for five seasons , from March 1989 through May 1993.
The theme for the series was written by Mike Post . [4] It was later rearranged for the fifth season, except for the series-finale episode, which featured the original theme music. Scores for the episodes were composed by Post and Velton Ray Bunch .
A soundtrack album was first released in 1993, titled Music from the Television Series 'Quantum Leap' , dedicated to John Anderson , who played Pat Knight in The Last Gunfighter . It was released by GNP Crescendo on CD and cassette tape .

The Quantum Leap series was initially moved from Friday nights to Wednesdays. It was later moved twice away from Wednesdays to Fridays in late 1990, and to Tuesdays in late 1992. The series finale aired in its Wednesday slot in May 1993. [4]
The most frequent time slot for the series is indicated by italics :
- Sunday at 9:00–11:00 pm on NBC: March 26, 1989
- Friday at 9:00–10:00 pm on NBC: March 31, 1989 – April 21, 1989

In the United Kingdom, the show began on BBC Two on February 13, 1990, [10] airing Tuesday evenings at 9:00 pm. The final episode was scheduled to be aired on June 14, 1994, but altered schedules after the death of British dramatist Dennis Potter earlier that month delayed the airing until June 21, 1994. [11] Repeat episodes continued on the channel at various times until December 28, 1999. [12]
During the summer of 1990, NBC scheduled a ""Quantum Leap Week"". Over the course of five consecutive nights, repeat episodes of the show were broadcast in an effort to drum up interest in the fledging series. [13] The ""Quantum Leap Week"" was repeated during the summer of 1991. Each of the weekly events was supported by a series of advertisements. In each were a series of "" man-on-the-street "" attempting to say ""Quantum Leap Week"" fast, with varied levels of success. [14] [15]
Universal Studios has released the entire, digitally remastered , Quantum Leap series on DVD . [16] [17] Some controversy arose when fans discovered that many songs had been replaced from the soundtrack due to music rights issues. For the fifth season, Universal included all of the original music. [18]
On April 13, 2016, Mill Creek Entertainment announced that it had acquired the rights to the series and re-released the first two seasons on DVD on June 7, 2016. [19]
On February 7, 2017, Mill Creek re-released Quantum Leap - the Complete Series on DVD and also released the complete series on Blu-ray for the first time. [20] The 18-disc set contains all 97 episodes of the series, as well as most of the original music restored for all seasons.

At the end of season five, Bellisario was told to write an episode that could serve as a season finale or series finale, as it was unclear whether Quantum Leap would be renewed. The episode contained some answers to long-standing questions about the show, but contained enough ambiguity for a season six. When the show was not renewed, two title cards were tacked on to the end of the last episode; one read that Al's first wife Beth never remarried, so they were still married in the present day and had four daughters. The last title cards said ""Sam Becket [sic] never returned home."" The finale was met by viewers with mixed feelings. [21] [22] [23]
A few years [ when? ] after the airing of the finale, a script for an alternate ending was leaked on the internet. It implied that Al, through encouragement of his wife Beth, would become a leaper to go after Sam and that they would be leaping into the future. Bellisario has said no script exists and that he does not know where this idea came from. In 2018, however, fan Allison Pregler purchased title cards taken from season five that contained some shots of Al and Beth together; this implies that part of the alternate ending was, in fact, shot and gives credibility to the alternate-ending scenario. [24] [25] In May 2019, a video of the lost footage was uploaded to Reddit by a contributor with the handle Leaper1953. [26] How this person obtained the footage is not known publicly. Scott Bakula confirmed that several endings were shot and that the footage was authentic. [27]
The series had a slow start in the ratings, and its timeslot was moved often, but it did well in the 18–49 demographic. The finale was viewed by 13 million American households. [28] In 2004 and 2007, Quantum Leap was ranked number 15 and 19, respectively, on TV Guide 's ""Top Cult Shows Ever"". [1]

Few of the comic stories referenced episodes of the television series, with the exception of the ninth issue, ""Up Against a Stonewall"".
In July 2002, the Sci-Fi Channel (which at the time was airing reruns of the show) announced development of a two-hour television film based on Quantum Leap that would have served as a backdoor pilot for a new series, with Bellisario as executive producer. [33]
In July 2010 during the TV Guide panel at the San Diego Comic-Con International , Scott Bakula said that Bellisario was working on a script for a projected Quantum Leap feature film . [34] Bellisario confirmed in October 2017 at the L.A. Comic Con that he had finished the script. [35]
In January 2020, Jeff Bader, NBC's head of program planning and strategy, announced that the network was considering a reboot of Quantum Leap for the launch of its Peacock streaming service. [36]
In January 2022, NBC greenlit a pilot episode of a Quantum Leap sixth season revival. Bellisario is involved, while the showrunners include Steven Lilien and Bryan Wynbrandt, with Deborah Pratt and Martin Gero as executive producers. The pilot will take place 30 years after the conclusion of the original series, with a new team reviving Project Quantum Leap to understand both it and the fate of Sam Beckett.

This is because the letter ""J"" is pronounced two different ways, depending on the letter that follows it. When it follows a vowel, it is pronounced like the ""Y"" in ""yes"". When it follows a consonant, it is pronounced like the ""H"" in ""house"".
There are 44 sounds in the English language. To make these sounds, you use your mouth, tongue, and lips. English has 20 vowel sounds and 24 consonant sounds.
The English language has four main tones of voice: high, low, rising, and falling. Each tone of voice changes the pitch of your voice.
The high tone is a high pitch, like when you say ""eeee"".
The low tone is a low pitch, like when you say ""oooo"".
The rising tone is a high-pitched tone that starts low and rises in pitch, like when you say ""huh?""
The falling tone is a low-pitched tone that starts high and falls in pitch, like when you say ""uh-oh"".
There are five vowel sounds in the English language that are pronounced with the mouth in a different position. These vowel sounds are: /æ/, /ɛ/, /ɪ/, /ɒ/, and /ʌ/.
The /æ/ sound is pronounced like the a in ""bat"".
The /ɛ/ sound is pronounced like the e in ""bed"".
The /ɪ/ sound is pronounced like the i in ""sit"".
The /ɒ/ sound is pronounced like the o in ""cot"".
The /ʌ/ sound is pronounced like the u in ""but"".
There are an infinite number of sounds in the world, but only a limited number of sound types. Sound is created by vibrating objects, which cause air pressure waves to form. These pressure waves can be detected by our ears and interpreted by our brains as sound.
There are three main types of sound: mechanical, electrical, and acoustic. Mechanical sounds are created by physical objects vibrating, such as a tuning fork or a guitar string. Electrical sounds are caused by electricity flowing through a circuit, such as in a telephone or a stereo. Acoustic sounds are created by objects vibrating the air, such as when you speak or sing.
There are many different types of acoustic sounds. The most basic type is a simple tone, which is just a single frequency or pitch. Complex tones are created by combining multiple simple tones, and they can be heard when you play a musical instrument or sing a note. Timbre is the characteristic sound of a particular instrument or voice, and it is determined by the mix of frequencies that are present in a complex tone.
Sound can also be classified by its intensity or volume. Loud sounds have a higher pressure wave amplitude than soft sounds, and they can be heard over a greater distance. High-pitched sounds are typically louder than low-pitched sounds, because they have a higher frequency.
There are also a number of environmental factors that can affect the sound that we hear. Weather conditions, such as wind or rain, can create sound waves that interfere with the normal sound waves. The type of surface that the sound wave is hitting can also make a difference. Hard surfaces, such as concrete or metal, reflect sound waves more than soft surfaces, such as grass or cloth. This is why it is easier to hear someone’s voice when they are standing near a hard surface than when they are standing near a soft surface.
Finally, the distance between the source of the sound and the listener also affects the sound that we hear. The farther away the source is, the weaker the sound will be. This is why it is harder to hear someone talking in a noisy room than it is to hear them talking in a quiet room.

There are 44 letter sounds in the English language. Each letter has a unique sound, and when put together, they create words.
The 44 letter sounds are: a, b, c, d, e, f, g, h, i, j, k, l, m, n, o, p, q, r, s, t, u, v, w, x, y, and z.
Each letter has a unique sound, and when put together, they create words. The best way to learn the letter sounds is to practice with flashcards, or by reading aloud.
Phonics is a method of teaching reading and spelling that is based on the understanding that letters of the alphabet represent the sounds of speech. The 42 phonics sounds are the basic sounds that make up the English language.
The most common way to represent the phonics sounds is with a phonetic alphabet. This alphabet assigns a letter to each phonics sound. For example, the phonics sound /a/ is represented with the letter a, the phonics sound /i/ is represented with the letter i, and the phonics sound /z/ is represented with the letter z.
There are a number of different phonetic alphabets, but the most common one is the International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA). The IPA assigns a unique letter to each phonics sound, regardless of the language. So, the phonics sound /a/ is represented with the letter a in English, but it is represented with the letter ä in German, and the letter a in Spanish.
The IPA is shown below with the 42 phonics sounds represented by their corresponding letter.
Phonemes are the basic units of sound in a language. There are 44 phonemes in the English language, and each one has a unique sound. Learning the phonemes in English is an important step in learning to speak the language correctly.
The 44 phonemes in English are divided into two categories: consonants and vowels. Consonants are made by obstructing airflow in the mouth, while vowels are produced by letting the air flow freely.
There are 20 consonants in English: b, c, d, f, g, h, j, k, l, m, n, p, q, r, s, t, v, w, x, and y. Each consonant has a unique sound, and they are all pronounced slightly differently depending on the surrounding letters.
There are 24 vowel phonemes in English: a, e, i, o, u, and the six diphthongs: au, aw, ei, eo, ie, oi. Each vowel has a unique sound, and they are all pronounced slightly differently depending on the surrounding letters.
One important thing to remember is that the letter “e” can be pronounced as either a consonant (in words like “bed”) or a vowel (in words like “beet”). The letter “y” can also be pronounced as a vowel (in words like “yes”) or a consonant (in words like “yacht”).
The best way to learn the 44 phonemes in English is to practice pronouncing them aloud. You can find phoneme charts online that show how each phoneme is pronounced. You can also practice by listening to native English speakers and repeating the sounds they make.
There are three types of sounds in the English language – vowels, consonants, and diphthongs.
Vowels are the most common type of sound in English. There are five vowel sounds in English – a, e, i, o, and u. Vowels are produced when the vocal cords vibrate and air is expelled from the lungs.
Consonants are produced when the vocal cords vibrate and air is not expelled from the lungs. There are 24 consonant sounds in English. Consonants are produced by air hitting the tongue, teeth, and lips.
Diphthongs are two vowel sounds that are produced when one vowel sound is followed by another vowel sound. There are 12 diphthongs in English. Diphthongs are produced when the vocal cords vibrate and air is expelled from the lungs.",source_text/d9e3b88f3270567b88984b7bbef7f5d60d51cf60329e89e8d8b3b17c61fac646-neeva_0_0.txt,"The English language has about 44 sounds, including 20 vowel sounds and 24 consonant sounds.",complete_support,False,sounds - vowel - phonemes - 44 - english - alphabet - consonant - distinct - tongue - varieties,StanfordCitation,0.62,0.5833333333333334,0.59,0.54,[0.992449164390564],[0.992449164390564]

During its 12 season run on Fox, it was hard to find another show which so capably blended disparate genres and tones as the network's offbeat procedural drama Bones . Based on the writings of famed forensic anthropologist Kathy Reichs (who authored several works of fiction very loosely based on her own life), Bones followed the tale of Reich's literary alter-ego Temperance ""Bones"" Brennan (played by Emily Deschanel), who pairs up with a hotshot FBI Agent (David Boreanaz) and utilizes her anthropological expertise in solving some of the Agency's most baffling, and often grisly, murder cases.
The series debuted in 2005, earning a small but devoted legion of fans who continued to devour Bones ' twisty narratives, unabashed flourishes of gore, and wicked sense of humor, over a whopping 245 episodes . And while the core cast of Bones remained mostly intact during its lengthy run, the series also became quite well-known for its revolving door of supporting players , many of whom brought welcome tinges of comedy to the show's sometimes horrific storylines.
While there were several familiar faces amongst those Bones part-timers (Joel David Moore, Carla Gallo, Ryan O'Neal, Stephen Fry), it's safe to assume few were quite as recognizable as the bearded face of the man who portrayed the father of the Jeffersonian's facial reconstruction specialist Angela Montenegro (Michaela Conlin). That ""actor's"" name is Billy Gibbons.
And if you're wondering why the word actor is in quotations, well, it's because acting is Gibbons' backup gig. Here's why Angela's father from Bones looks so familiar.
20th Television
If you call yourself a rock fan, you should be as familiar with Billy Gibbons' name as you almost certainly are his beautifully-bearded face. That's because the Texas-born Gibbons is a legit rock legend, who Rolling Stone listed as one of the greatest guitarists of all time in 2015, and whose band entered the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame in 2004. That band is none other than ZZ Top , who rose to rock superstardom in the 1970s and 1980s on the strength of Gibbons' gritty vocals and singular, blues-drenched guitar sound.
Gibbons first made a name for himself on the rock scene fronting the late-sixties Texas psych outfit The Moving Sidewalks, who opened a handful of shows for Jimmy Hendrix circa 1969. A couple of years later, Gibbons assembled the iconic, hot rod-loving three-piece ZZ Top, and has spent the ensuing decades kicking out the jams (i.e. ""Tush,"" ""La Grange,"" ""Legs,"" ""Sharp Dressed Man,"" and more) and tripping the rock & roll life fantastic as a full-blown guitar god. Gibbons and the boys in ZZ Top are still cranking out hits, by the way, with the singer-guitarist telling the Las Vegas Review-Journal in 2020 that a new album is imminent.
Gibbons' recurring Bones gig finally came to an end after his memorable 2014 appearance. But it's a safe bet he'll continue to turn up in other film and television projects, moving forward, as the famed axe-man has made great sport of parodying his distinctive persona over the years. The question now becomes not if, but where, Gibbons and his gnarly beard will turn up next.",source_text/74b085270c315c12f5c8c4434cbccfa68896335538bb205fc41d26f2df83eb86-perplexity_0_2.txt,"it's safe to assume few were quite as recognizable as the bearded face of the man who portrayed the father of the Jeffersonian's facial reconstruction specialist Angela Montenegro (Michaela Conlin).

Kim's Convenience is a Canadian television sitcom that aired on CBC Television from October 2016 to April 2021. It depicts the Korean Canadian Kim family that runs a convenience store in the Moss Park neighbourhood of Toronto : parents ""Appa"" ( Paul Sun-Hyung Lee ) and ""Umma"" ( Jean Yoon ) – Korean for dad and mom , respectively – along with their daughter Janet ( Andrea Bang ) and estranged son Jung ( Simu Liu ). Other characters include Jung's friend and coworker Kimchee ( Andrew Phung ), his manager Shannon ( Nicole Power ) and Janet's friend Gerald Tremblay ( Ben Beauchemin ). The series is based on Ins Choi 's 2011 play of the same name .
The first season was filmed from June to August 2016 at Showline Studios in Toronto. It is produced by Thunderbird Films in conjunction with Toronto's Soulpepper Theatre Company , with Lee and Yoon reprising their roles from the play.

However, since January 2020, it is no longer available in all markets (e.g., the Netherlands), making the fourth season unavailable to a worldwide audience. The third season premiered January 8, 2019 and the fourth premiered January 7, 2020. [2]
On March 31, 2020, it was initially announced that the show had been renewed for two more seasons, [3] and on March 8, 2021, it was revealed that the show would end after the fifth season, due to the departure of the show's two co-creators. [4] [5] Since the show's cancellation, several of the show's actors have publicly discussed production issues, particularly criticising a lack of diversity among behind-the-scenes staff. [6] [7] [8]

Interior scenes at the store, Handy Car Rental and home are shot at Studio City Toronto (formerly Showline Studios) at 915 Lake Shore Boulevard East, where an exact replica of Mimi Variety, the model for the store, has been recreated. The studio is also used as the exterior of the car rental business. One episode was shot in Koreatown at Bloor and Christie Streets.
The long-established Mimi Variety store at 252 Queen Street East is used for exterior shots and as the model for the interior set built in the studio. While the signage has been adjusted, the ""Kim's Convenience"" sign uses the same red and green lettering as the original sign. All other sections, such as the ""7 DAYS A WEEK"" element, are the original signage of Mimi Variety. [16] The owners of the Mimi Variety store have retained the new signage, even though the business has not officially changed its name. [16] [17] The producers also painted a mural on an exterior wall, mostly seen in the credit sequence and for stock transitional shots, as well as for promotional shots.
Episodes for season 5 were filmed in 2020 under strict protocols during the COVID-19 pandemic in Canada . Simu Liu had planned to return to Toronto for the start of production once he was finished shooting Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings in Australia. Since filming for both projects overlapped due to delays caused by the pandemic, he was only able to return to Toronto toward the end of production, where he continued shooting for nine days until he had completed ""all the stuff that he missed out on"". [18]
On March 8, 2021, it was announced that the series would be coming to an end after the fifth season, despite being renewed for a sixth season a year earlier, due to the departure of series creators Choi and White, who decided to move on to other projects after the production completion on the fifth season. The show's producers, Thunderbird Films, ultimately decided not to move forward with the sixth season, believing that they would not be able to deliver the ""same heart and quality"". [19] One of the aforementioned projects was a spin-off of the show, Strays , which would center on character Shannon Ross, played by Nicole Power , and was developed by White with Kim's producer Ivan Fecan serving as executive producer. [9] Fecan explained that Choi was unsure of how to continue with the show beyond the fifth season. [9] The cast and crew attempted to persuade Choi to remain for the show's planned sixth and final season, but ultimately Choi decided to depart the show. [6] [9] Paul Sun-Hyung Lee , who played Appa in both the series and the original play, said that Choi stopped contacting Lee after speaking with him about staying on the show. He later said the series ""died from within...No matter how good it can be, if you don’t deal with issues from within and try to gloss it over because everything on the surface looks fantastic and idealistic, then you are just asking for trouble. I think that’s the unfortunate lesson from this whole thing.” [6] Fecan decided to end the show as he believed the series could not continue without Choi. [9]
On June 2, 2021, cast member Simu Liu claimed that the show suffered from a lack of diversity among writers and producers and that there was discord behind the scenes. He also claimed that actors were not allowed to offer creative input and that the cast was poorly paid. [7] Shortly after, on June 6, 2021, actor Jean Yoon stated on social media that ""[A]s an Asian Canadian woman, a Korean-Canadian woman w [sic] more experience and knowledge of the world of my characters, the lack of Asian female, especially Korean writers in the writers' room of Kim's [Convenience] made my life very difficult and the experience of working on the show painful."" [8] Liu also stated that he would not reprise his role in the Strays spin-off due to it focusing on Nicole Power's character Shannon, the only white main character from the show. [20] John Doyle of The Globe and Mail noted the complexities of the situation, explaining that since all of the other major characters in Kim's Convenience were drawn from Ins Choi 's original theatrical play , and Shannon was the only character who had been newly created specifically for the television series, she was the only character who was the intellectual property of the show's producers and thus the only one who could be spun off without Choi's participation. [21]
Entertainment One released the first two seasons of Kim's Convenience on Region 1 DVD on March 7, 2017. [22]

The show was released to mostly positive reception from critics. On review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes , the first season holds an approval rating of 100% based on 13 critics' reviews, with an average rating of 9/10. [24] John Doyle of The Globe and Mail wrote that the show ""stays away from the pseudo-seriousness that could easily plague a comedy about immigrants and family dynamics."" In conclusion, Doyle called it ""a clever, generally engaging screwball comedy with an eye on entertainment"". [25] The Toronto Star 's Tony Wong wrote that ""the show is good. Possibly even great. The dialogue is sharp, on point and borderline subversive. It has the potential to be a future classic. It has bite...It's funny and true, but not a reality we typically see reflected on television."" [26] Reviewing the series following its release for US audiences on Netflix, Bryan Washington of Vulture remarked on the series' treatment of political issues surrounding immigrants, noting the tensions are never truly in the background but also do not take precedence over the comedy, remarking ""I haven't laughed as hard all year, with feeling, as I have alongside the series."" [27]
Despite the series being based on a play by Korean Canadian Ins Choi, and Choi writing over a third of the 65 episodes, Rick Salutin , also of the Star , was less enthusiastic of the show's portrayal of minorities on television saying ""only accents are funny in Kim's Convenience"" and that audiences are ""laughing at the characters not with them"". Salutin concluded by stating ""I don't see why supporting Canadian culture means you should be uncritical, as if someone will take it away if you weren't. You should be most critical about what you care most about like public education or the CBC, you want them to be good not just there"". [28] Although not directly a response to Salutin's review, actor Paul Sun-Hyung Lee (Appa) has questioned critics' inclination to cite accents as offensive:
They won’t say—but is it because you’re seeing Asians on the screen? Oh, no? Well, then it must be because he sounds different. Well, guess what: Asian people have accents. The accent isn’t about a joke, it’s part of who that character is, but it doesn’t make it intrinsically racist. If you’re uncomfortable with that baggage, then you need to examine it yourself and see where it comes from. [29]
Mark Breslin , founder of the Canadian comedy club chain Yuk Yuk's , was critical of the show's lack of strong humour:
As a sitcom, it's more sit than com. It's pleasant to watch but just not that funny. The characters aren't exaggerated enough. They lack big comic flaws. The conflicts are subtle and minor key. You want to give its creators kudos for finally putting Asians on TV in the right way, but the whole enterprise plays like a civics lesson. The characters all behave with dignity, and dignity may be the enemy of laughter. [30]
Midway through its first season, Kim's Convenience was estimated by Numeris to have an average audience of 933,000 per episode, with 39% of viewers between the ages of 25 and 54. [31]
For the 5th Canadian Screen Awards in 2017, Kim's Convenience garnered 11 nominations, including Best Comedy Series, Best Actor in a Comedy Series (Lee), Best Actress in a Comedy Series (Yoon and Bang), and Best Supporting Actor in a Comedy Series (Phung). [32] Lee won the award for best actor in a continuing leading comedic role for his portrayal of Appa, [33] and Phung won Best Supporting Actor for his portrayal of Kimchee. [34]
Kim's Convenience won two awards at the 2017 Toronto ACTRA Awards , Outstanding Performance - Female for actress Jean Yoon and the Members’ Choice Series Ensemble Award for Best Cast. [35] [36]
The first-season episodes ""Ddong Chim"" and ""Janet's Photos"" are 2017 Writers Guild of Canada 's Canadian Screenwriting Awards finalists in the TV comedy category. [37]
At the 6th Canadian Screen Awards in 2018, the series received 12 nominations. It won the awards for Best Comedy Series , Best Actor in a Comedy Series (Lee) and Best Supporting Actor in a Comedy Series (Phung).
As the show's third season aired in the winter of 2019 rather than the fall of 2018, it did not air inside the eligibility period for the 7th Canadian Screen Awards .

You’ve probably heard things like this: Men get turned on at the slightest provocation and are ready to have sex anytime, anywhere, while women tend to want sex less often and have to be “in the mood.” For years, that’s been the widespread belief: Men just have higher sex drives than women.
Research has often been cited to back up the idea that, perhaps because of their higher testosterone levels, men think more about sex, seek it more actively, and get turned on more easily. Men’s sexuality is like an on-off switch, while women’s sexuality is a complicated network of connections. Right?
Actually, no.
Other research – along with an evolving understanding of sexuality, gender, and desire – are telling us that sex drive doesn’t fit neatly into columns labeled “male” and female.”
“Not only is the idea that men have higher sex drives an oversimplified notion, but it’s really just not true,” says Sarah Hunter Murray, PhD, a marriage and family therapist and the author of Not Always in the Mood: The New Science of Men, Sex, and Relationships.
“Our social norms and the ways we’re raised to either lean into our sexuality or repress it have a huge impact on how we experience our sexuality and how we report it in studies,” Hunter Murray says. “People raised as men in our society have been typically given more permission to speak openly about wanting sex, while young women have often been told not to express their sexuality.”
Justin Garcia, PhD, executive director of the Kinsey Institute at Indiana University, agrees.

“Our sexual interest is driven by many factors, including not only biology, age, and use of medications , but also by situation – for both men and women,” he says. “Sexual attitudes are affected significantly by societal and religious attitudes. If you’ve been told that expressing your sexuality is bad, over time that will impact your sense of whether you should be doing it or not.”
And those messages may have influenced the research that has been telling us men want sex more than women.
In a 2007 study, researchers aimed to find out how much social norms influenced how men and women reported sexual behaviors including masturbation , their number of sexual partners, and watching pornography. The people they studied – all college students – were asked the same set of questions but were split into three groups.
- One group was told that the research assistants (their college-aged peers) would see their answers.
- A second group was connected to a lie detector machine and told (incorrectly) that it would know if they were not telling the truth.
- The third group was not connected to the lie detector during their survey and was also not told that their answers would be seen.
In almost all questions, men and women tended to report different levels of sexual activity when they thought peers would be seeing their answers. Sex differences were much smaller in the lie detector group.
For example, when they believed peers would see their responses, men reported masturbating much more often than women did. But those differences virtually disappeared in the lie detector group.
And when people believed that their peers would see their answers, men reported having about 3.7 sexual partners, while women reported about 2.6. In the lie detector group, men reported about 4.4 sexual partners and women about 4.0.
Despite stereotypes, a significant proportion of men – as many as 1 in 6 – regularly have low levels of sexual desire, meaning low enough for the person to see it as a problem. A 2010 review of multiple studies found that approximately 14% to 19% of men regularly and reliably indicated that they had problematically low or decreased sexual desire.
“Men aren’t walking robots that want to have sex at the drop of a hat,” Hunter Murray says. “We often don’t give men permission to talk about the things that lead to low sex drive, such as relationship dynamics, stress , exhaustion at work, parenting, and the chores and daily grind of life.”
It’s hard to gauge whether men really want sex more than women when you’re interviewing either men or women in isolation for research. If a man says he wants sex more than his female partner does, how do you know she’d see things the same way?
The few studies that have looked at sexual desire in a “dyadic” relationship – that is, they interviewed opposite-sex couples in a relationship with each other – have pretty consistently found that men are no more or less likely to be the partner who wants more sex, more often.
One of the first studies to find this pattern was done more than 20 years ago. Among group of 72 college-age, heterosexual couples, about half reported that they had similar levels of sexual desire. Among the couples who differed in their desire, about half of those said it was the male partner who wanted sex less often.
More recently, Hunter Murray published a similar study of college-age couples that had much the same results. About half of the couples had similar levels of desire. And among those who did not, men were just as likely as women to be the partner with lower sex drive.
“Multiple studies show that men’s and women’s sexual desire levels are more similar than different,” Hunter Murray says. There has not been much research on levels of desire in transgender and nonbinary people.
“Gender norms about sex drive are outdated in a lot of ways,” she says. “If there’s something about the way you experience desire that falls in line with a stereotype, that’s fine, but so many of us fall outside of these limited boxes. There are men whose interest in sex ranges from low to none, to very high, and it’s the same for women. As humans, we vary, and as long as your sexual expression is in a healthy way that feels good and right for you [and your partner(s)], chances are your experience is normal.”

Last week, Microsoft inadvertently revealed the difficulty of creating moral robots. Chatbot Tay, designed to speak like a teenage girl, turned into a Nazi-loving racist after less than 24 hours on Twitter. “Repeat after me, Hitler did nothing wrong,” she said, after interacting with various trolls. “Bush did 9/11 and Hitler would have done a better job than the monkey we have got now.”
Of course, Tay wasn’t designed to be explicitly moral. But plenty of other machines are involved in work that has clear ethical implications.
Wendell Wallach, a scholar at Yale’s Interdisciplinary Center for Bioethics and author of “A Dangerous Master : How to keep technology from slipping beyond our control,” points out that in hospitals, APACHE medical systems help determine the best treatments for patients in intensive care units—often those who are at the edge of death. Wallach points out that, though the doctor may seem to have autonomy, it could be very difficult in certain situations to go against the machine—particularly in a litigious society. “Is the doctor really free to make an independent decision?,” he says. “You might have a situation where the machine is the de facto decision-maker.”
As robots become more advanced, their ethical decision-making will only become more sophisticated. But this raises the question of how to program ethics into robots, and whether we can trust machines with moral decisions.
How to build an ethical machine
Broadly speaking, there are two main approaches to creating an ethical robot. The first is to decide on a specific ethical law (maximize happiness, for example), write a code for such a law, and create a robot that strictly follows the code. But the difficulty here is deciding on the appropriate ethical rule. Every moral law, even the seemingly simple one above, has a myriad of exceptions and counter examples. For example, should a robot maximize happiness by harvesting the organs from one man to save five?
“The issues of morality in general are very vague,” says Ronald Arkin, professor and director of the mobile robot laboratory at Georgia Institute of Technology. “We still argue as human beings about the correct moral framework we should use, whether it’s a consequentialist utilitarian means-justify-the-ends approach, or a Kantian deontological rights-based approach.”
And this isn’t simply a matter of arguing until we figure out the right answer. Patrick Lin, director of Ethics + Emerging Sciences Group at California Polytechnic State University, says ethics may not be internally consistent, which would make it impossible to reduce to programs. “The whole system may crash when it encounters paradoxes or unresolvable conflicts,” he says.
The second option is to create a machine-learning robot and teach it how to respond to various situations so as to arrive at an ethical outcome. This is similar to how humans learn morality, though it raises the question of whether humans are, in fact, the best moral teachers. If humans like those who interacted with Tay teach a machine-learning robot, then it won’t develop particularly ethical sensibilities.
In some ways, Tay’s ability to absorb what it was being taught is impressive, says Arkin. But he says the bot was “abused by people.” He adds:
“You can do that to a simpleton too. In many ways AIs are really simpletons. You can make a fool of somebody, and they chose to make a fool of the AI agent.”
Putting theories into action
How to create ethical robots isn’t simply an abstract theory; several philosophers and computer scientists are currently working on just such a feat.
Georgia Institute of Technology’s Arkin is working on trying to make machines comply with international humanitarian law. In this case, there’s a huge body of laws and instructions for machines to follow, which have been developed by humans and agreed by international states. Though some cases are less clear than others, Arkin believes his project will be complete in the next couple of decades.
His work relies a great deal on top-down coding and less so on machine learning—after all, you wouldn’t want to send someone into a military situation and leave them to figure out how to respond.
Meanwhile, Susan Anderson, a philosophy professor at the University of Connecticut, is working with her husband Michael Anderson, a computer science professor at the University of Hartford, to develop robots that can provide ethical care for the elderly. The Andersons’ approach relies far more on machine learning—but, instead of learning from the general public, the machines interact only with ethicists.
Susan Anderson says their work was influenced by philosophers John Rawls and W. D. Ross. While Rawls’ writing on “reflected equilibrium” says that moral principles can be extracted from the ethical decisions made in particular scenarios, Ross makes the case that humans have several prima facie moral duties. We have an obligation to each of these prima facie duties; however, none of them are absolute or automatically override the others. So, in cases where they conflict, they have to be balanced and weighed against each other.
The Andersons work with machine-learning robots to develop principles for elder healthcare. In one case, they created an intelligent system to decide on the ethical course of action when a patient had refused the advised treatment from a healthcare worker. Should the healthcare worker try and convince the patient to accept treatment or not? This involves many complicated ethical duties, including respect for the autonomy of the patient, possible harm to the patient, and possible benefit to the patient.
Anderson found that once the robot had been taught a moral response to four specific scenarios, it was then able to generalize and make an appropriate ethical decision in the remaining 14 cases. From this, she was able to derive the ethical principle :
“That you should attempt to convince the patient if either the patient is likely to be harmed by not taking the advised treatment or the patient would lose considerable benefit. Not just a little benefit, but considerable benefit by not taking the recommended treatment.”
Although in that early work, the robot was first coded with simple moral duties—such as the importance of preventing harm—the Andersons have since done work where no ethical slant was assumed. Instead, the intelligent system learnt even these moral principles from interacting with ethicists.
Should we trust robots with morality?
It’s clearly possible to create robots with some ethical abilities—but should we be pursuing such work? Anderson points out that in some ways, robots can be superior ethical decision-makers to humans.
“Humans are a product of natural selection so we have built into us ideas that are self-interested or at least in the interest of our group over others. These are a result of being able to survive as a species,” she says.
Humans are also prone to making mistakes, and are not perfect arbiters of justice.
That said, it’s unlikely robots will be able to address the most sophisticated ethical decisions for the foreseeable future. And certainly, while we’re still confused about certain moral sensibilities among humans, it would be unwise to hand the reigns over to robots. As Arkin points out, “Human moral reasoning is not well understood. Nor, in general, is it fully agreed upon.”
Anderson and the other professors I spoke to agree that machines should not function in areas where there’s moral controversy. And Lin adds that he questions whether it’s ethical, on principle, to offload the hard work of ethical decisions onto machines.
“How can a person grow as a person or develop character without using their moral muscle?,” he says. “Imagine if we had an exoskeleton that could make us move, run, life, and do all other physical things better. Would our lives really be better off if we outsourced physical activity to machines, instead of exercising our own muscles?”
Improving morality through robots
But though we may not want to leave the most advanced ethical decisions to machines just yet, work on robotic ethics is advancing our own understanding of morality.
Wallach points out that in his book “ Moral Machines : Teaching Robots Right from Wrong,” he argued that just as computers advanced the philosophical understanding of the mind, the same will become true for robots and the study of ethics. The Andersons developing a principle based on their healthcare intelligent system is just one example. Anderson points out that the history of ethics shows a steadily building consensus—and work on robot ethics can contribute to refining moral reasoning.
Robot ethics also highlights the elements of ethical decision-making aside from reasoning, says Wallach, such as moral emotions or knowledge of social norms. “Because we were talking about whether robots could morally reason, it forced us to look at capabilities humans have that we take for granted and what role they may have in making ethical decisions,” he says.
It might simply be impossible to reduce human ethical decision making into numerical values for robots to understand, says Lin—how do we codify compassion or mercy, for example. But he says that robot ethics can be seen as a problem of human ethics. “Thinking about how robots ought to behave is a soul searching exercise in how humans ought to behave,” he says. “It’s a way for us to know ourselves.”

Fanon's work often focused on the psychological effects of colonialism and racism on colonized peoples.",Fanon's work often focused on the psychological effects of colonialism and racism on colonized peoples.,"Franz Fanon, the Martiniquan born psychiatrist, committed Algerian revolutionary and Pan-African thinker, died 60 years ago on December 6, 1961 just after the publication of his last book, The Wretched of the Earth. To mark this 60th anniversary, Nigel C. Gibson has just published his collection, Fanon Today: The Reason and Revolt of the Wretched of the Earth . He discusses some important quotes from Fanon’s global classic .
Space
In the first chapter of The Wretched of the Earth , ‘On Violence,’ Fanon describes colonialism as a system of absolute violence that can only be opposed through violence. He references South Africa as he powerfully describes the colonial world expressed in space:
The colonist’s sector is built to last…a sector of lights and paved roads, where the trash cans constantly overflow with strange and wonderful garbage, undreamed-of leftovers…The colonist’s sector is a sated, sluggish sector, its belly is permanently full of good things.
In contrast, the colonised sector,
the shanty town, the Medina, the reservation…[is] a disreputable place inhabited by disreputable people. You are born anywhere, anyhow. You die anywhere, from anything. It’s a world with no space, people are piled one on top of the other, the shacks squeezed tightly together. The colonised’s sector is a famished sector, hungry for bread, meat, shoes, coal, and light.
He then adds an important measure of decolonisation,
If we examine closely this system of compartments…its ordering and its geographical layout will allow us to mark out the lines on which a decolonised society will be reorganised.
Fanon rocked the All-African Peoples Conference in December 1958 when he raised the issue of violence in contrast to Kwame Nkrumah’s nonviolent “positive action” agreed upon by many delegates. The following year Fanon became ambassador to Ghana and by then the crucial problem for Fanon was the lack of ideological clarity among leaders, regardless of their position on violence and nonviolence.
The rationality of revolt and the philosophy of organisation
The centrality of the “rationality of revolt” to a “new politics” is highlighted by these two quotes, from the end of chapter 2 and the beginning of chapter 3.
The insurrection proves to itself its rationality and demonstrates its maturity every time it uses a specific case to advance the consciousness of the people in spite of those within the movement who sometimes are inclined to think that any nuance constitutes a danger and threatens popular solidarity.
If the rationality of revolt becomes the material force of revolution where “violence represents the absolute line of action,” the “new politics is in the hands of…[those] who use their muscles and their brains to lead the struggle for liberation”.
But it is the cowardice and apathy of the “elite” and their “incapacity” to “rationalise popular practice” and “attribute it any reason” that leads to the postcolonial tragedy.
It was not only the leaders who were subject to Fanon’s anger. He was brutally honest in his criticism of the revolutionary militant:
It sometimes happens at meetings that militants use sweeping, dogmatic formulas. The preference for this shortcut, in which spontaneity and over-simple sinking of differences dangerously combine to defeat intellectual elaboration, frequently triumphs.
He calls the militant’s logic shocking and inhuman.
The nationalist bourgeoisie and their organisation
Given that he was writing at a moment when more than half of Africa had recently gained independence, his critique of the nationalist middle class and nationalist parties reads like a script which has been repeated over and over:
Privileges multiply and corruption triumphs…Today the vultures are too numerous and too voracious in proportion to the lean spoils of the national wealth. The party, a true instrument of power in the hands of the bourgeoisie, reinforces the machine, and ensures that the people are hemmed in and immobilised.
At the same time, wary of the rising xenophobia and chauvinism in newly independent West African nations, Fanon argues that national consciousness is not in fact nationalism. Rather, national consciousness “enriched and deepened into humanism…is the only thing that will give us an international dimension.” For him the building of a nation has to be “accompanied by the discovery and encouragement of universalising values.”
A new humanism
Those universal values are expressed in the four-page conclusion to The Wretched of he Earth :
So, comrades, how is it that we do not understand that we have better things to do than follow Europe?
Fully cognisant of the fact that neocolonialism can wear a Black or Arab face, Fanon is critical of how newly independent African countries, even when they used the language of socialism, didn’t do much more than follow Europe’s model, looking to take over the colonial apparatus – its states and institutions – for their own interests. Fanon considered this a product of the crisis of thought, the lack of a philosophy of liberation.
That same Europe, where they were never done talking with humanity, never stopped proclaiming that they were only anxious for the welfare of humanity. Today we know with what sufferings humanity has paid for every one of their triumphs of the mind.
Fanon rejects the humanism proclaimed in Europe. Based on colonisation, exploitation, slavery and violence, European humanism dehumanises. And so “We must find something different”. He rejects what is central to European humanism, profit and the reduction of the human to outputs in production.
“If conditions of work are not modified,” he adds, “centuries will be needed to humanise this world which has been forced down to animal level by imperial powers”. He’s saying, humanising the world means rethinking everything, “work[ing]out new concepts… and setting afoot a new humanity”.
Time as the space for human development
Fanon envisioned time akin to Karl Marx’s great phrase, as “space for human development”.
The sense of time must no longer be that of the moment or the next harvest, but rather that of the rest of the world.
Humanising the world means creating a new conception of time, the time to create a new society.
We have realised that the masses are equal to the problems which confront them…experience proves that the important thing is not that three hundred people form a plan and decide upon carrying it out, but that the whole people plan and decide even if it takes them twice or three times as long. The fact is that the time taken up by explaining, the time ‘lost’ in treating the worker as a human being, will be caught up in the execution of the plan.
Rather than top-down the plan should come from “the muscles and the brains of the citizens” because “people must know where they are going, and why”. In the early pages of The Wretched of the Earth Fanon speaks of those dehumanised beings who become historical protagonists through the struggle.
This is just the beginning, the work of humanising the world does not end there, in fact by the end of the book it is clear that while this remains a crucial turning point because consciousness, let alone material reality, are not changed overnight. Mental and physical liberation has to be ongoing after the colonists had been kicked out. The “new society”, the liberated “new person” – collectively, socially, and individually – has to be consciously and intentionally developed.",source_text/2925aea0c73186743e033edbe3df972537ce54828b75b71b710484c642bdc865-perplexity_1_0.txt,,no_support,True,gullivers - gulliver - travels - lemuel - fanon - oppressed - frantz - satirical - satire - colonialism,StanfordCitation,0.47,0.4433333333333333,0.44,0.42,[0.36633679270744324],[0.36633679270744324]

Take a credit counseling course.5. Pay the filing fee and submit your forms to the court.6. Attend a meeting with creditors and answer any questions they may have.7. Wait for a decision from the court regarding your case.","The bankruptcy process can be complex, but generally involves the following steps:","Article I, Section 8, of the United States Constitution authorizes Congress to enact ""uniform Laws on the subject of Bankruptcies."" Under this grant of authority, Congress enacted the ""Bankruptcy Code"" in 1978. The Bankruptcy Code, which is codified as title 11 of the United States Code, has been amended several times since its enactment. It is the uniform federal law that governs all bankruptcy cases.
The procedural aspects of the bankruptcy process are governed by the Federal Rules of Bankruptcy Procedure (often called the ""Bankruptcy Rules"") and local rules of each bankruptcy court. The Bankruptcy Rules contain a set of official forms for use in bankruptcy cases. The Bankruptcy Code and Bankruptcy Rules (and local rules) set forth the formal legal procedures for dealing with the debt problems of individuals and businesses.
There is a bankruptcy court for each judicial district in the country. Each state has one or more districts. There are 90 bankruptcy districts across the country. The bankruptcy courts generally have their own clerk's offices.
The court official with decision-making power over federal bankruptcy cases is the United States bankruptcy judge, a judicial officer of the United States district court. The bankruptcy judge may decide any matter connected with a bankruptcy case, such as eligibility to file or whether a debtor should receive a discharge of debts. Much of the bankruptcy process is administrative, however, and is conducted away from the courthouse. In cases under chapters 7, 12, or 13, and sometimes in chapter 11 cases, this administrative process is carried out by a trustee who is appointed to oversee the case.
A debtor's involvement with the bankruptcy judge is usually very limited. A typical chapter 7 debtor will not appear in court and will not see the bankruptcy judge unless an objection is raised in the case. A chapter 13 debtor may only have to appear before the bankruptcy judge at a plan confirmation hearing. Usually, the only formal proceeding at which a debtor must appear is the meeting of creditors, which is usually held at the offices of the U.S. trustee. This meeting is informally called a ""341 meeting"" because section 341 of the Bankruptcy Code requires that the debtor attend this meeting so that creditors can question the debtor about debts and property.
A fundamental goal of the federal bankruptcy laws enacted by Congress is to give debtors a financial ""fresh start"" from burdensome debts. The Supreme Court made this point about the purpose of the bankruptcy law in a 1934 decision:
[I]t gives to the honest but unfortunate debtor…a new opportunity in life and a clear field for future effort, unhampered by the pressure and discouragement of preexisting debt.
Local Loan Co. v. Hunt , 292 U.S. 234, 244 (1934). This goal is accomplished through the bankruptcy discharge, which releases debtors from personal liability from specific debts and prohibits creditors from ever taking any action against the debtor to collect those debts. This publication describes the bankruptcy discharge in a question and answer format, discussing the timing of the discharge, the scope of the discharge (what debts are discharged and what debts are not discharged), objections to discharge, and revocation of the discharge. It also describes what a debtor can do if a creditor attempts to collect a discharged debt after the bankruptcy case is concluded.
Six basic types of bankruptcy cases are provided for under the Bankruptcy Code, each of which is discussed in this publication. The cases are traditionally given the names of the chapters that describe them.
Chapter 7 , entitled Liquidation, contemplates an orderly, court-supervised procedure by which a trustee takes over the assets of the debtor's estate, reduces them to cash, and makes distributions to creditors, subject to the debtor's right to retain certain exempt property and the rights of secured creditors. Because there is usually little or no nonexempt property in most chapter 7 cases, there may not be an actual liquidation of the debtor's assets. These cases are called ""no-asset cases."" A creditor holding an unsecured claim will get a distribution from the bankruptcy estate only if the case is an asset case and the creditor files a proof of claim with the bankruptcy court. In most chapter 7 cases, if the debtor is an individual, he or she receives a discharge that releases him or her from personal liability for certain dischargeable debts. The debtor normally receives a discharge just a few months after the petition is filed. Amendments to the Bankruptcy Code enacted in to the Bankruptcy Abuse Prevention and Consumer Protection Act of 2005 require the application of a ""means test"" to determine whether individual consumer debtors qualify for relief under chapter 7. If such a debtor's income is in excess of certain thresholds, the debtor may not be eligible for chapter 7 relief.
Chapter 9 , entitled Adjustment of Debts of a Municipality, provides essentially for reorganization, much like a reorganization under chapter 11. Only a ""municipality"" may file under chapter 9, which includes cities and towns, as well as villages, counties, taxing districts, municipal utilities, and school districts.
Chapter 11 , entitled Reorganization, ordinarily is used by commercial enterprises that desire to continue operating a business and repay creditors concurrently through a court-approved plan of reorganization. The chapter 11 debtor usually has the exclusive right to file a plan of reorganization for the first 120 days after it files the case and must provide creditors with a disclosure statement containing information adequate to enable creditors to evaluate the plan. The court ultimately approves (confirms) or disapproves the plan of reorganization. Under the confirmed plan, the debtor can reduce its debts by repaying a portion of its obligations and discharging others. The debtor can also terminate burdensome contracts and leases, recover assets, and rescale its operations in order to return to profitability. Under chapter 11, the debtor normally goes through a period of consolidation and emerges with a reduced debt load and a reorganized business.
Chapter 12 , entitled Adjustment of Debts of a Family Farmer or Fisherman with Regular Annual Income, provides debt relief to family farmers and fishermen with regular income. The process under chapter 12 is very similar to that of chapter 13, under which the debtor proposes a plan to repay debts over a period of time – no more than three years unless the court approves a longer period, not exceeding five years. There is also a trustee in every chapter 12 case whose duties are very similar to those of a chapter 13 trustee. The chapter 12 trustee's disbursement of payments to creditors under a confirmed plan parallels the procedure under chapter 13. Chapter 12 allows a family farmer or fisherman to continue to operate the business while the plan is being carried out.
Chapter 13 , entitled Adjustment of Debts of an Individual With Regular Income, is designed for an individual debtor who has a regular source of income. Chapter 13 is often preferable to chapter 7 because it enables the debtor to keep a valuable asset, such as a house, and because it allows the debtor to propose a ""plan"" to repay creditors over time – usually three to five years. Chapter 13 is also used by consumer debtors who do not qualify for chapter 7 relief under the means test. At a confirmation hearing, the court either approves or disapproves the debtor's repayment plan, depending on whether it meets the Bankruptcy Code's requirements for confirmation. Chapter 13 is very different from chapter 7 since the chapter 13 debtor usually remains in possession of the property of the estate and makes payments to creditors, through the trustee, based on the debtor's anticipated income over the life of the plan. Unlike chapter 7, the debtor does not receive an immediate discharge of debts. The debtor must complete the payments required under the plan before the discharge is received. The debtor is protected from lawsuits, garnishments, and other creditor actions while the plan is in effect. The discharge is also somewhat broader (i.e., more debts are eliminated) under chapter 13 than the discharge under chapter 7.
The purpose of Chapter 15 , entitled Ancillary and Other Cross-Border Cases, is to provide an effective mechanism for dealing with cases of cross-border insolvency. This publication discusses the applicability of Chapter 15 where a debtor or its property is subject to the laws of the United States and one or more foreign countries.
In addition to the basic types of bankruptcy cases, Bankruptcy Basics provides an overview of the Servicemembers' Civil Relief Act, which, among other things, provides protection to members of the military against the entry of default judgments and gives the court the ability to stay proceedings against military debtors.
This publication also contains a description of liquidation proceedings under the Securities Investor Protection Act (""SIPA""). Although the Bankruptcy Code provides for a stockbroker liquidation proceeding, it is far more likely that a failing brokerage firm will find itself involved in a SIPA proceeding. The purpose of SIPA is to return to investors securities and cash left with failed brokerages. Since being established by Congress in 1970, the Securities Investor Protection Corporation has protected investors who deposit stocks and bonds with brokerage firms by ensuring that every customer's property is protected, up to $500,000 per customer.
The bankruptcy process is complex and relies on legal concepts like the ""automatic stay,"" ""discharge,"" ""exemptions,"" and ""assume."" Therefore, the final chapter of this publication is a glossary of Bankruptcy Terminology which explains, in layman's terms, most of the legal concepts that apply in cases filed under the Bankruptcy Code.",source_text/bbc4e08e141c10ff01aa819a772b31c6743bcb2822dca4c99b24ca0070ab63bd-perplexity_0_1.txt,"The bankruptcy process is complex and relies on legal concepts like the ""automatic stay,"" ""discharge,"" ""exemptions,"" and ""assume.""",partial_support,True,bankruptcy - file - submit - counseling - 1099a - chapter - petition - credit - filing - complete,StanfordCitation,0.54,0.49666666666666665,0.49,0.46,[0.6434116959571838],[0.6434116959571838]

Real Madrid have a chance to win a fourth successive European trophy this seas, but who was the last English team victorious in the competition?
With the last 16 draw for this season's Champions League having been finalised, fans have exciting matches to look forward to – such as Manchester United facing off with Paris Saint-Germain and last year's finalists Liverpool taking on Bayern Munich.
Real Madrid and Barcelona's dominance in Europe has been well-known, but who was the last Premier League team to have won the Champions League? Goal takes a look.
Real Madrid won the Champions League earlier this May after beating Liverpool 3-1 in the final.

In doing so, Zinedine Zidane's side earned their third successive European title – the first team in history to do so – after also winning the tournament in 2017 and 2018.
In fact, the Spanish giants have dominated the competition over the last decade, and have been winners of the tournament four times within the last five years.

Real Madrid have won the Champions League and the previous European Cup the most number of times, with 13 victories overall.
Prior to their 2013-14 victory over crosstown rivals Atletico Madrid, they were winners of the Champions League three times in 1998, 2000 and 2002.
Following Los Blancos, Italian side AC Milan have won the Champions League seven times, last winning the tournament in 2007 after beating Liverpool in the final.
The victory was revenge for when the two sides met in 2005 and the Italians famously squandered a 3-0 lead at half-time as the Merseysiders – underdogs to begin with – fought back after the break to level the scoreline to 3-3 before ultimately claiming the win through penalty shootout.
The trio of Bayern Munich, Barcelona and Liverpool have all won the competition five times apiece, with the German side being the last non-La Liga side to lift the Champions League trophy in 2013 when they emerged as winners against Bundesliga rivals Borussia Dortmund.
Barcelona last lifted the trophy in 2015, when they beat Juventus in the final to deny icon Gianluigi Buffon in one of his last chances to taste European glory with his long-term club.
Only five sides from England have won the top European honour – though two teams had won the title only when it was known as the European Cup and not the Champions League prior to the 1992-93 season.
Chelsea are the last Premier League team to have won the Champions League when they were victorious in 2012 over Bayern Munich in the final.
The 2012 success was their first Champions League title. The Blues topped a group that consisted of Bayer Leverkusen, Valencia and Genk to earn a Round of 16 tie against Napoli, before defeating Benfica 3-1 on aggregate in the semi-finals.
The West London side were underdogs throughout the competition and especially so when they were matched with Barcelona in the semi-finals, and famously won 1-0 at home and maintained a 2-2 draw at the Camp Nou to progress on aggregate.
In the final, Thomas Muller thought he had clinched an 83rd-minute victory for Munich on home turf before Didier Drogba levelled just five minutes later – and it took a penalty shootout for the Blues to claim victory at the Allianz Arena.
Manchester United have won the Champions League three times, and were last winners in in 2008 when they defeated Premier League rivals Chelsea in the final in Moscow.
The Red Devils did manage to reach the final of the competition twice in recent seasons –the following year in 2009 and then once again in 2011 – but were ultimately bested by Barcelona on both occasions. Prior to 2008, they won the honour in 1968 and 1999.
Aston Villa and Nottingham Forest both won the European Cup (the latter side having won the honour twice), before its rebrand as the Champions League.
Liverpool were last winners of the trophy in 2005 during the aforementioned famed 'Miracle' of Istanbul.
As five-time winners of the Champions League, Liverpool are the most successful English side in the Champions League.
Following their fifth trophy in 2005, the Anfield club were allowed to keep their trophy permanently, following wins in a particularly illustrious period of the club's history in 1977, 1978, 1981 and 1984.
Manchester United are on three trophies but Liverpool retain the honour of being the most decorated English side in European football following their epic 2005 victory in Turkey.
Much like Chelsea did in 2012, Liverpool started the Champions League campaign in 2004-05 as underdogs – finishing second in a group with Monaco, Olympiakos and Deportivo La Coruna.
Liverpool's ultimately victorious Champions League campaign was memorable for many things, particularly for it being the first season of Rafael Benitez managing the side as well as some iconic individual player moments – Gerrard fulfilling his role as captain and netting against Olympiakos in the group stage to keep Liverpool in the competition, as well as semi-final heroics against Jose Mourinho's Chelsea side.
In the final against Milan in 2005, Liverpool found themselves 3-0 down at the break but, in the second half, managed to level the scoreline in just six minutes, starting with a Gerrard opener, followed by a Vladimir Smicer strike and an equalising 3-3 penalty taken by Xabi Alonso – culminating in a penalty shootout.
Since then, the epic final has since been remembered as simply 'Istanbul' and remains to be one of the most thrilling and iconic Champions League finals – and fixtures – in football history.",source_text/3460888e273eba42ef683a7affdcfda9123b8b9b7f719098aeed51566ee95f56-neeva_1_0.txt,The 2012 success was their first Champions League title.,complete_support,False,league - champions - manchester - premier - chelsea - fa - arsenal - trophies - uefa - liverpool,StanfordCitation,0.67,0.6233333333333334,0.67,0.53,[0.124402716755867],[0.124402716755867]

Jack Patrick Fallon (October 13, 1915 – May 22, 2006) [1] was a British jazz bassist born in Canada.
Fallon played violin and studied with London Symphony Orchestra founder Bruce Sharpe [2] before making double-bass his primary instrument in 1935 [3] when he was 20 years old. [4] During World War II he played in a dance band in the Royal Canadian Air Force , and settled in Britain after his discharge. He joined the band of Ted Heath in 1946, and played bebop in London clubs in his spare time. In 1947 he played with Ronnie Scott and Tommy Whittle at the Melody Maker / Columbia Jazz Rally, and following this worked with Jack Jackson (1947), George Shearing (1948), Duke Ellington (1948), [1] and Django Reinhardt (1949). Soon after playing with Reinhardt, he played in a Count Basie ensemble which also included Malcolm Mitchell and Tony Crombie ; he played with both of them after leaving Basie, working together with Hoagy Carmichael and Maxine Sullivan and touring in Sweden together with Reinhardt and Stéphane Grappelli .
Fallon worked in the 1950s as an accompanist to Mary Lou Williams , Sarah Vaughan , and Lena Horne , and also served as a sideman in the ensembles of Humphrey Lyttelton , Kenny Baker , and Ralph Sharon . Additionally, he was house bassist at Lansdowne Studios. He worked outside of jazz with blues musicians such as Big Bill Broonzy and Josh White , [5] and played with Johnny Duncan 's Blue Grass Boys. As the bass guitar became more popular, Fallon became a champion of its use, and played both instruments in the latter part of his career.
Fallon was also involved in the industry as a booker/promoter, having established the booking agency Cana Variety in 1952. Cana booked primarily jazz artists in its early stages but expanded to rock acts in the 1960s, including The Beatles and The Rolling Stones . Because of this connection, Fallon was asked by the Beatles to play violin fiddle style on the song "" Don't Pass Me By "" (from The Beatles ) in 1968. [6] [7]
In 1957, Fallon married Jean Lovell and they had three children. [6] Fallon continued to play jazz locally in London and in the studios into the 1990s. He retired from performing in 1998 due to ill health. [1] In 2002, he was awarded the Freedom of the City of London . [2] He published a memoir entitled From the Top in 2005, and died the following year at age 90. His funeral was held on June 7, 2006 in London. [8] In 2015, he was posthumously inducted into the London Music Hall of Fame (in London, Ontario ).

Access to quality healthcare is a basic human right, and everyone should be able to access the care they need without worrying about financial barriers. Universal healthcare policies aim to reduce the financial burden associated with accessing health care services, eliminating the need for patients to pay out-of-pocket expenses or face a financial burden due to medical bills. Additionally, free health care policies can help reduce health disparities by providing access to care for marginalized and underserved populations, leading to improved health outcomes.","Additionally, free health care policies can help reduce health disparities by providing access to care for marginalized and underserved populations, leading to improved health outcomes.","Free health care policies – or politiques de gratuité – are about removing formal user fees. The removal of fees may apply to all health services, to the primary care level, to selected population groups, to selected services for everyone, or to selected services for specific population groups characterized by medical or economic vulnerability.
Evidence about the impact of FHC policies in terms of financial protection and health service utilization is mixed. If well-designed and implemented, FHC policies can expand coverage in countries with few resources and can therefore be part of a strategy and a catalyst to move towards universal health coverage (UHC).
Free health care policies aim to reduce the financial barriers that people may experience when trying to access health services. They eliminate formal user fees at the point of service.
Examples of services under a free health care policy include:
antenatal care
assisted deliveries
caesarean sections
health services for children below a defined age (often 5 years)
health services for elderly people above a certain age (often 65 years).
These services are chosen to protect population groups deemed to be especially vulnerable, particularly low-income groups.
Defined geographical areas or easy-to-observe socio-demographic criteria such as age, sex or pregnancy are used to determine whether a person is eligible for free health services at the point of use. This is in contrast to relying on income or another means of assessment to determine whether an individual is entitled to exemption from user fees.
With limited budget resources to fund FHC as a way to make progress towards UHC, there are inevitable trade-offs, which lead to decisions about prioritizing particular services or population groups over others.
When introducing a FHC policy, a government explicitly intends to make progress towards UHC in two ways:
increasing service utilization for specific services, in line with people’s health needs
improving financial protection.
FHC policies also aim to enhance the quality of the health services guaranteed through this policy. Transparency and accountability are important aspects, as eligible people need to know if the policy applies to them.
While FHC policies may trigger an increase in the use of services, evidence on improved financial protection is mixed. People may still have to make direct payments for other services they need.
Moreover, if not properly anticipated and backed by increased supplies and medicines, FHC may have negative unintended consequences, such as patients having to pay for this scarce supply informally or in the private sector. Also, if user fees previously retained at the facility level are abolished, their effect as a direct incentive for health workers disappears, possibly leading to demotivated staff.
Overall, the impacts of FHC policies have so far been mixed, especially for poor people, who may not benefit at all, or benefit to a lesser extent compared with better-off people. There are differences across and within countries, but overall, public funding tends to benefit better-off populations. Various aspects on the supply and demand sides may cause this trend in public funding. On the supply side, availability of health services is better in wealthier areas. On the demand-side, barriers can be financial and non-financial, such as limited geographical access to facilities or cultural and language barriers.
Finally, setting up separate funding and remuneration mechanisms for FHC policies (when not linked with other health financing mechanisms) may contribute to fragmenting the health financing system. When there are several FHC policies in place for a variety of services, they may create disincentives to enrol in health insurance schemes with more comprehensive benefit packages.
Preparatory and complementary measures are needed for free health care policies to be successful.
Sufficient financial resources need to be provided to the facility level to compensate for both the loss of revenue at the provider level and the desired increase in use of services.
Provider payment methods and effective allocation channels must be in place before a FHC policy comes into effect. This is also critical to incentivize health workers.
Diagnosing and addressing the factors that prevent the poor from using priority health services are all critical to ensuring FHC policies benefit the most vulnerable.
Health services must be made available to the most distant and vulnerable population groups. A related measure is to increase the autonomy of health service providers.
Policy makers need to look for synergies and ensure that FHC policies lead towards a coherent health financing architecture.
FHC policies for specific services or population groups may not benefit the poor as much as a targeted fee exemption based on income assessment or means testing, but in practice a FHC policy may be more feasible to implement.
Provided they are well-designed and implemented and part of a wider strategic vision, FHC policies can effective instrument for broader reforms aimed at achieving UHC.",source_text/b278d4c0d9b16ce2ca711c776c9d4c0eaa702debf2eec64431652721005ad0f7-you_1_0.txt,"Free health care policies – or politiques de gratuité – are about removing formal user fees.

The recipes listed on this page are for use with paper strips and paste . You’ll find my paper mache clay recipe on a separate page.
If you’re looking for a fast start on your next paper mache project, any of the recipes on this page will work with my new downloadable patterns for sculptures and masks .
This has been my favorite paper mache paste for years. It’s also the paste our friend Dan Reeder uses to make his wonderful dragons and monsters. However, keep reading to see when it might not be the best option for your next project.
Paper mache paste is easy to make, and it doesn’t really need a recipe. The most important tip is to use hot water (from the tap, not boiling) to make a nice smooth paste.
Ingredients for easy paper mache paste:
- Flour
- Hot Water from the Tap
To make the paste , just pour some white flour in a bowl. Add hot water gradually until you have a consistency that will work well. Mix with a spoon or whisk. If you have one, an immersion blender works great).
How thick should you make your paste? You want it thin enough so it looks more like white glue than pancake batter – although thicker paste will work OK, too, if that’s the way you like it. You really can’t make it wrong.
What kind of flour will work? You’ll need to use all-purpose white flour. Whole-wheat flour makes healthier bread, but it isn’t sticky enough to make good paste.
Make up just enough for one sculpting session. This is good advice for any paste made with wheat flour. Wild yeast is attracted to flour (that’s how sourdough bread is made.)
If the paste is kept over from one session to the next, the yeast will break down the flour and make the paste less sticky (and slightly stinky). It’s best to whip up as much as you need today, throw out any paste that’s left over, and make a new batch tomorrow – or whenever you need some more. (If you need a paste that can be kept for longer periods of time, see the Elmer’s Art Paste, below.)
Be sure to clean the bowl and utensils before the paste has time to dry – it will dry very hard. That’s good for paper mache, but not so good for the person washing the dishes.
Tips: This paste is easy and strong, but it will leave a floury residue on the outside of your sculpture. If you want the last layer of paper to be seen on the finished sculpture, you’ll need one of the clear paste alternatives below.
And if you have a gluten allergy , you’ll want to use one of the gluten-free alternatives.
Cooked paper mache paste will dry almost clear, unlike the raw paste, and the surface of your paper mache sculpture will be slightly smoother.
Ingredients:
- 2 Tablespoons of white flour
- 1 cup of cold water
Mix the white flour and water in a small saucepan. Stir until there are no lumps. A whisk works really well for this.
Put the pan on the stove at medium heat and slowly bring it to a boil, stirring constantly.
When it begins to thicken, be sure to watch carefully and keep stirring, to make sure it doesn’t burn. Stir with a silicone spatula if you have one. As soon as it starts to bubble, remove the pan from the heat and allow the paste to cool.
The paste will be somewhat runny when it’s hot, but it will gel slightly as it cools. You’ll obviously want to keep your hands out of it while it’s still hot enough to burn.
Tips: This is an excellent choice if you need a paste that dries clear . However, if you have a gluten allergy, you’ll need one of the options below.

If you need a paste that dries perfectly clear, you can use Elmer’s Glue-All (or any white PVA glue) mixed with just enough water to make the glue thinner and easier to spread.
I often use Titebond III wood glue with masks that need to be light and strong. You can see a video about that here.
Acrylic Gel can be used as paste. This is the product that I use when I add colored tissue paper as a final layer over a paper mache sculpture. You do need to make sure the paper mache underneath is completely dry, because the acrylic medium could dry first and seal moisture inside. .
I use the gel medium with tissue paper for two reasons: It dries perfectly clear, and it doesn’t cause the fragile tissue paper to fall apart quite as fast as water-based paste does. You do still need to handle the paper carefully, of course.

The phrase ""architecture is frozen music"" is attributed to Johann Wolfgang von Goethe. It's a metaphor that compares the structure and design of buildings to musical compositions. Just as music is composed of notes arranged in a specific way to create a harmonious whole, architecture is composed of lines, curves, and materials arranged to create a visually pleasing structure. What do you think about this comparison?","The phrase ""architecture is frozen music"" is attributed to Johann Wolfgang von Goethe.","The simplest and famous definition of architecture is ‘the art and science of designing and building structures’ but we all seem to agree with Goethe on the idea that architecture uses music as a medium to express its ideas. Music is a powerful medium for expressing ideas and ideas are powerful because they can be expressed in many different ways.
Music can express ideas in a variety of ways, but it can also express them in ways that are very different from the way we normally think of them. For example, music can convey ideas about the nature of the universe, the meaning of life, and the purpose of our existence.
This is the power of music and this is why it is so important to understand how it works and how we can use it to communicate our ideas to the world.
Table of Contents
The software that allows the brain activity to interact with the music and visuals in real time is specially designed. “Music is liquid architecture; it is the brain’s way of communicating with its environment. The brain is not a computer. It is a network of neurons, each of which is connected to other neurons by synapses. Synapses are the junctions between neurons that allow them to communicate with each other.
When a neuron fires, it sends a signal to the next neuron, and so on, until all the neurons in the network are firing at the same time. This process is called “synaptic firing” and is what allows us to hear, see, feel, smell, taste, touch and think. The synapse is like a switch that can be turned on or off.
If the switch is turned off, the neuron does not fire, but if it’s switched on then it does fire. In the case of music, when we hear a song, we are sending a message to our brain that , “Hey, I’m listening to this song and I like it.”
The brain then interprets this message and decides whether or not we want to listen to it again, or if we should just stop listening and go back to something else.
As such, architects listen to music to concentrate, draw inspiration and brainstorm ideas. The rhythm of the human voice and the rhythms of music are what bring architecture and music together. Music and architecture have a long history, dating back to ancient Greece and Rome. In the ancient world, music was often used as a form of divination, as it was believed that it could predict the future.
It was also used to communicate with the gods. Romans were also the first to use musical instruments, such as the lyre, the flute and the harp. These instruments were used for religious purposes, but they also served as instruments of war, for example in the battle of Thermopylae in 480 BC, when the Greeks defeated the Persians in a series of musical duels.
“Architecture is frozen music,” Johann Wolfgang von Goethe said, but musicians and architects don’t have to be frozen in time. They can be creative and innovative. I think it’s important to remember that architecture is not just about buildings. It’s also about the people who live and work in them, and how they relate to each other and to the world around them.
I think that’s a very important part of the architecture that we’re talking about today. We need to think about how we can create a better world for people, for our children and for future generations. We can’t do that by just building more and more buildings, or by building bigger and bigger things. That’s not going to solve the problem, it will just make it worse.
And it won’t solve it in a way that will make people feel good about themselves or make them feel proud of their country or their city.
The skills and knowledge of architects and engineers can be distinguished from the art and technique of designing and building. Architectural design is a branch of architecture that deals with the design and construction of buildings, structures, and other structures.
It is the study of how buildings are built and how they are designed. The term architecture is used to refer to all aspects of building design, including design of materials, construction methods, materials and methods of construction, architecture and engineering.
Musical terms such as rhythm, texture, harmony, proportion and articulation refer to architecture and music. Rhythm in music is the pattern of sounds in relation to a beat, repetition of elements in a piece of music, and harmony is the relationship between elements of a musical composition. The term “rhythm” is also used to describe the rhythmic relationships between musical elements.
For example, in the music of Beethoven, the beat is the fundamental unit of the composition, and the rhythm of each note is determined by its relationship to that beat. In other words, a note that is played at the same time as another note plays at a different time. This is known as a syncopation, or a “syncopated” note.
It is important to note, however, that this is not the only way in which the beats are related to one another. The most common of these is by the use of intervals. Intervals are a way of grouping notes together in order to create a pattern of notes that are repeated over and over again.
In music, it refers to layers of sounds and rhythms produced in different instruments, and in architecture, it refers to different materials used in our music. In architecture it is used to describe the way a building is built and how it looks and feels. It is also used as a way of describing the architecture of a city or a country.
Sound is a spatial event, a material phenomenon and an auditive experience rolled into one. The distance, direction, and location are all used to describe it. Every built space can modify, position, reflect or reverberate the sounds of the surrounding environment. The soundscape of a building is not just a collection of sounds, it is an interaction between the building and its surroundings.
This interaction is often referred to as the’soundscape’ or ‘auditive’ experience. In this article, we will look at how soundscapes are created, how they are manipulated, and how we can use them to enhance the experience of living and working in a city.
Architecture is more than just a record of who we are.
Determining who we want to be, or what it would mean to be fully human, is one of the most important tasks of our time, because the fundamental purpose of architecture is as a means for creating our cultures and ourselves.
The exhibition will be on display at the Museum of Modern Art (MoMA) in New York City from September 27 to October 2, 2014.
The root of the word architecture is the Greek arkhitekton (“master builder”), which makes sense because the ancient Greeks were very skilled at architecture — think of Alexander the Great, who built the Parthenon and the Acropolis. Architecture is not just about the building of buildings, though. It’s also about how the buildings are designed and how they are used.
For example, if you want to build a house, you don’t just build the house. You also design it, and then you use it to live in. That’s what architects do — they design and use buildings to help people live better lives.",source_text/d245c3785fc057893687c16f5e6654d3571a4ecd172c55fd6ec09fcce8bfe1b5-bing_chat_0_0.txt,"“Architecture is frozen music,” Johann Wolfgang von Goethe said,",complete_support,False,architecture - paintings - art - goethe - wolfgang - frozen - music - johann - comparison - reproduction,StanfordCitation,0.59,0.5033333333333333,0.46,0.46,[0.9657782316207886],[0.9657782316207886]

It also helps us respond to the world around us by filtering out information that is not relevant to our intentions. The RAS acts as a gatekeeper of information that is let into our conscious mind.","The Reticular Activating System (RAS) is a bundle of nerves located throughout the brainstem that regulates behavioral arousal, consciousness, and sleep-wake cycles.","The reticular activating system (RAS) is a component of the reticular formation in vertebrate brains located throughout the brainstem. Between the brainstem and the cortex, multiple neuronal circuits ultimately contribute to the RAS. [1] These circuits function to allow the brain to modulate between slow sleep rhythms and fast sleep rhythms, as seen on EEG. By doing this, the nuclei that form the RAS play a significant role in coordinating both the sleep-wake cycle and wakefulness. The groupings of neurons that together make up the RAS are ultimately responsible for attention, arousal, modulation of muscle tone, and the ability to focus. [2]
The RAS is a component of the reticular formation, found in the anterior-most segment of the brainstem. The reticular formation receives input from the spinal cord, sensory pathways, thalamus, and cortex and has efferent connections throughout the nervous system. The RAS itself is primarily composed of four main components that each contain groupings of nuclei. These are the locus coeruleus, raphe nuclei, posterior tuberomammillary hypothalamus, and pedunculopontine tegmentum. Each is unique in the neuropeptides they release. In large part, these centers are activated by the lateral hypothalamus (LH), which releases the neuropeptide orexin in response to the light hitting the eyes, which then stimulates arousal and the transition from sleep to waking. [3]
The locus coeruleus is located within the upper dorsolateral pons of the brainstem. It is activated directly by orexin from the lateral hypothalamus, and in response, releases norepinephrine. Its excitatory functions are widely distributed within the brain, acting on both the alpha and beta receptors of neurons and glial cells distributed throughout the cortex. It functions primarily upon waking and in arousal. [4] [5]
The raphe nuclei are located midline throughout the brainstem within the pons, midbrain, and medulla. The majority of neurons located in the raphe nuclei are serotonergic. The more rostral raphe nuclei appear to be important in various bodily functions, including pain sensation and mood regulation. In the context of the RAS, these nuclei communicate with the suprachiasmatic nucleus, playing a role in circadian rhythms, and contributing to arousal and attention. [6]
The tuberomammillary nucleus is located within the posterior aspect of the hypothalamus. The neurons that make up these nuclei are primarily histaminergic and serve as the primary source of histamine projections in the brain. They are important in both wakefulness and cognition, projecting in large part to the forebrain where they play an important role in arousal. [7] [8]
The lateral and dorsal pedunculopontine tegmentum contains primarily cholinergic neurons in neighboring groups within the midbrain and pons. Cholinergic neurons project to the thalamus and cortex, promoting desynchronization of the brain, allowing the body to switch from slow sleep rhythms to high frequency, low amplitude wake rhythms. [9]
The neural tube, a derivative of the ectoderm, forms during the third week of embryogenesis. It splits into mesencephalon, prosencephalon, and rhombencephalon. The prosencephalon then further divides into the telencephalon and diencephalon. The thalamus and hypothalamus arise from the diencephalon. The mesencephalon, the central most of these structures, goes on to form the midbrain, while the rhombencephalon, the most caudal of these structures, forms both the metencephalon and the myelencephalon. The metencephalon is the precursor of the pons and cerebellum, while the myelencephalon gives rise to the medulla. Together, the pons, midbrain, and medulla contain the majority of constituents functioning within the reticular activating system, all of which were initially derived from the neural tube during embryogenesis. [10]
The RAS and its associated structures exist primarily within the hypothalamus and brainstem. The hypothalamus receives vascular perfusion mainly by branches of the circle of Willis, which sits inferiorly to the hypothalamus.
The brainstem is supplied primarily by branches of the basilar artery, which arises from the vertebral arteries. The caudal medulla receives blood supply from the anterior spinal artery medially and the posterior spinal artery laterally. Its more rostral portions are perfused by the posterior inferior cerebellar artery laterally and branches of the basilar artery medially.
Moving superiorly, the pons receives the majority of its blood supply from penetrating branches of the basilar artery. More laterally, it also receives vascular supply from branches of the anterior inferior cerebellar artery.
The midbrain, located rostral to the pons, primarily receives blood supply from branches of the posterior cerebral artery. [11]
While the components of the reticular activating system are composed primarily of neural tissue, they do play an important role in the regulation of muscle tone in different states of sleep, as well as wakefulness. The thinking is that the RAS contributes to the suppression of muscle tone we experience during REM sleep, keeping us from moving our extremities during our dreams. The RAS may also play an important role in modulating muscle tone while awake, as it mediates arousal, and thus plays an important role in our ""fight or flight"" response to various threats. [12] [13]
Brainstem gliomas, as well as other tumors, may require neurosurgical removal. Research has found that the removal of tumors from regions around and/or inside of the brainstem can result in lesions affecting the function locus coeruleus, impairing REM sleep, and the functioning of the RAS. It is crucial to consider both the size and position of a tumor when contemplating the inherent risk of neurosurgery on areas proximal to the brainstem. [14]
The reticular activating system is thought to have a role in a variety of pathologies. Certain studies have suggested an affiliation between the RAS and the physiologic production of pain stimuli. In response to direct stimulation via electrodes, the reticular activating system has been shown to generate a pain response. [15]
The RAS has been further implicated in a variety of psychological disorders. Schizophrenic patients have been shown to have a statistically significant increase in the amount of pedunculopontine neurons, which are intricate in modifying the cholinergic component of the RAS. [16] Patients with both Parkinson disease and PTSD have been shown to have a decreased density of neurons in the locus coeruleus, which further affects the disinhibition of the pedunculopontine neurons.
Additionally, patients with Parkinson disease frequently have REM sleep disturbances. research suggests that the degeneration of the RAS contributes to the progression of Parkinson disease. Furthermore, narcolepsy, a disorder characterized by uncontrollable daytime sleepiness, is thought to be in part a result of major loss of orexin peptides, as well as the reduced output of pedunculopontine neurons.

- Energy investment has increased since the onset of the war in Ukraine.
- Three-quarters of the growth in investment is from renewable energy.
- Progress varies between countries, with emerging markets struggling to invest more in clean energy.
The total energy bill paid by the world’s consumers is likely to top $10 trillion for the first time in 2022 , according to the latest report from the International Energy Agency (IEA).
Energy prices have soared as a result of the war in Ukraine and the decision of many nations, including the EU, the US and the UK, to significantly reduce their dependence on Russian oil and gas.
Despite the pain of the price spike, there is an upside: the supply shortages are leading to renewed investment in renewable energy sources.
These three charts from the IEA’s report show how the energy investment landscape is changing.
Global energy investment is set to increase by over 8% in 2022 to reach a total of $2.4 trillion.
This is well above pre-COVID levels.
However, almost half of the increase in capital spending is linked to higher costs so will not equate to an equivalent amount of increased energy supply.
Clean energy investment is expected to top $1.4 trillion in 2022, a significant acceleration after many years of slow progress.
It now accounts for almost three-quarters of the growth in overall energy investment, and has been growing at an average annual rate of 12% since 2020.
Investments in renewable power, greater energy efficiency and electric vehicles are all driving the increase.
The IEA describes the progress as “a significant step in the right direction” but also warns that investment in renewable energy is not yet at the level needed to meet international climate goals.
There is significant regional variation within the growth of renewable energy investment.
While China and advanced economies such as the EU and the US are forging ahead, it is a different story for many emerging markets.
And clean energy spending in emerging and developing economies, excluding China, remains stuck at 2015 levels.
In a statement accompanying the renewable energy report, the IEA’s executive director Fatih Birol, called for quicker progress: “A massive surge in investment to accelerate clean energy transitions is the only lasting solution,” he advised.
“This kind of investment is rising, but we need a much faster increase to ease the pressure on consumers from high fossil fuel prices, make our energy systems more secure, and get the world on track to reach our climate goals.”

In most American elections, the winning candidate is the one who receives the most votes, even if most voters selected someone else. Some states in the Deep South hold runoffs between the top two vote-getters if no candidate receives at least 50% of total votes, ensuring whoever wins is supported by a majority of the electorate. In a small but growing number of states and municipalities, another majoritarian system—ranked choice voting, or RCV—is used. RCV combines the general election and the runoff by letting voters select—or “rank”—the candidates in order of preference. If no candidate receives 50% of the first-choice votes, the lowest-ranking candidate is eliminated, and their second-place votes are reallocated among the remaining candidates. The process repeats itself until a winner is selected. Variations of RCV exist for different types of elections, including races with multiple winners.
Advocates of RCV claim the system has many benefits over traditional American elections, including:
- More positive campaigning because candidates have an incentive to be voters’ second-choice option.
- Reduced political polarization, because only candidates with broad support can win.
- Eliminating the “spoiler effect,” empowering voters to select third-party candidates without hindering the “lesser of two evils.”
- Cost savings over traditional runoff elections.
This report collates existing research on these and other questions into 18 sections. NCSL also surveyed local election officials implementing or currently running elections using RCV to gather insights on a series of administrative questions. Each section is written to be understood as a stand-alone report. No additional context is needed. The questions are divided into two sections: administrative and policy. NCSL offers this information in the hope that it’s useful to policymakers considering RCV legislation but does not take a position on whether the system should be adopted.

Exhausted vote
When a ranked choice ballot becomes inactive and cannot be advanced in the tabulation for a contest because there are no further valid rankings on the ballot. Exhausted ballots are not necessarily cast by mistake; the voter could have intentionally left some candidates unranked.
Overvote
A phenomenon that occurs when the number of selections made by a voter in a contest is more than the maximum number allowed. Overvotes result in spoiled ballots.
Plurality voting
(aka first-past-the-post) An election system in which a candidate who receives more votes than any other wins but does not need to receive an absolute majority (more than 50%).
Ranked choice voting
(aka instant runoff voting) An election system which allows each voter to rank candidates in order of the voter’s preference, and votes are counted in rounds using a series of runoff tabulations to eliminate candidates with the fewest votes, with a winner only selected once a candidate receives a majority of votes in a single winner contest.
Residual vote
A ballot where too many candidates are ranked, or fewer candidates are ranked than permitted.
Spoiled ballot
A ballot which contains a voter error or is otherwise marred and is not tabulated.
Spoiler candidate
A non-winning candidate whose presence on the ballot affects which candidate wins. Unrelated to spoiled ballot.
Statistical significance
An analytical way to quantify whether a result is likely due to chance or likely is due to a specific cause.
It costs money to implement ranked choice voting (RCV), as is the case with virtually any change in a voting system. Prior to this report, no comprehensive studies had explored the costs associated with switching to RCV from a traditional plurality-winner voting system. A key focus of NCSL’s survey of local election officials who conduct elections using RCV was to determine the cost of switching to RCV, particularly given how salient fiscal concerns are to policymakers.
NCSL’s survey focused on the one-time costs associated with transitioning to RCV, not recurring costs associated with repeated use of RCV. While some costs could be construed as recurring, they are costs jurisdictions will face at the moment of transition and are thus included below. The survey asked offices to estimate the following costs:
- Equipment changes or software costs needed to conduct RCV elections, if any.
- Costs associated with educating voters on how to cast an RCV ballot.
- Any additional purchases of single-use items like ballot paper, perhaps in anticipation of an increase in ballot spoilage in the first election using RCV, or because RCV ballot items take up more space than plurality ballot items.
- The total cost of labor dedicated to implementing any of the above changes.
- The total cost of labor dedicated to implementing RCV above and beyond the above changes.
Of the local election jurisdictions that answered these questions, the average cost of switching to RCV was estimated at $154,759. Excluding the highest and lowest outliers, the average drops to $39,679. The median cost, which is less sensitive to outliers, is $17,000. Because jurisdictions using RCV vary in size, cost-per-voter may be a better metric of costs to jurisdictions. The mean cost per voter was 94 cents; the median cost was 43 cents.
The key factors affecting transition costs are the size of the jurisdiction, whether consultants or outside groups were brought in to smooth the transition to RCV, and the cost of labor to a local election office. One jurisdiction reported its greatest expense was retaining legal counsel to help determine a permissible way to implement RCV under state law. One county that conducts RCV on behalf of its cities reported passing on a fixed amount to cities to cover their transition expenses, including the cost of a license to an RCV add-on, but unanticipated expenses ended up costing the county more than it received in fees under its contracts with the cities.
Costs can be offset by savings depending on circumstances. In fact, switching to RCV can be a net money saver if, by using RCV, an election and a runoff election can be combined into a single election, or a primary election can be consolidating with a general election. Total savings can be significant. According to a report published by FairVote and Third Way , runoff elections frequently exceed 50% of the cost of the first election. The possible savings per runoff could be in the hundreds of thousands, if not higher. The exact calculation will vary depending on a jurisdiction’s circumstances.
NCSL’s survey found the average cost of switching to RCV was $154,759 among responding jurisdictions. When the highest ($1,000,000) and lowest ($0) amounts were excluded, the average dropped to $39,673. The median cost was $17,000. Costs-per-voter averaged 94 cents; the median cost was 43 cents. According to NCSL's survey, the key factors impacting the cost of switching to RCV included labor, whether any existing equipment needed to be replaced or supplemented, whether legal or public affairs expertise was acquired to ease the transition, and the size of the jurisdiction. Savings are possible if a RCV election can be used to combine two separate elections, such as a primary and a primary runoff.
Any election system requires the following: a method of marking ballots (which can be as simple as voter-supplied pens for filling in bubbles) and a method of tabulation for in-person votes; inclusive options for voters with disabilities; options for sending ballots to overseas voters; and options for mailing absentee ballots to eligible voters. If a jurisdiction conducts post-election audits, these systems must comply with any record-keeping or other auditing requirements as well. A report by the RCV advocacy group FairVote recommended jurisdictions ask their vendors whether equipment changes are needed to conduct elections with RCV. The number of changes needed to conduct an election with RCV will vary depending on the jurisdiction, and getting answers from potential vendors can help with decision-making. NCSL’s survey of local election officials implementing RCV asked for an itemized list of election equipment that was replaced, modified or enhanced to allow elections to be conducted using RCV. Table 1 shows the number of jurisdictions that reported replacing equipment or software of various kinds.

Note: Equipment and software replacement is required when existing equipment is nearing the end of its useful life, regardless of whether RCV is implemented.
Any election system needs to design ballots, print ballots, permit voters to mark ballots process voted ballots, tabulate votes, report unofficial results on election night, and depending on state law, provide an auditable trail. RCV does not fundamentally change these basics. No additional equipment is necessary to conduct an election using RCV, and all election equipment currently on the market likely has the capacity to run RCV elections—so any jurisdiction that plans to replace existing but potentially outdated equipment will gain this capability. To minimize potential technology costs, jurisdictions considering switching can check with their existing vendors to see if software patches or equipment changes would be necessary to carry out RCV elections.
It is common that within a given state, counties or local jurisdictions use different voting systems. In theory, this diversity could make running statewide RCV elections harder. Maine is the only state that, so far, has used ranked choice voting for any statewide offices. According to Verified Voting , a nonpartisan organization that tracks election equipment use in local jurisdictions, Maine’s localities run elections with hand-marked paper ballots tabulated either by hand or with tabulators from the vendor Election Systems & Software (ES&S). Ballot marking devices are available for voters with disabilities. No jurisdictions in Maine use direct recording electronic voting equipment, or DREs.
Later this year, Alaska will become the second state to conduct statewide RCV elections. Unlike Maine, Alaska’s elections are run at the state level, a product of its vast size and lowest-in-the-country population density. Like Maine, Alaska’s elections are entirely run with hand-marked paper ballots, but all Alaskan ballots are tabulated with machines produced by Dominion Voting Systems. Also, like Maine, Alaska offers ballot marking devices for voters with disabilities and does not offer DREs.
Just because the two states currently or soon running elections with RCV have only one voting technology vendor uniform statewide does not prove that such systems are necessary. NCSL could not identify any research analyzing the ability of running a multi-jurisdiction RCV election on different equipment types. NCSL’s survey only had one response from a jurisdiction that runs ranked choice voting elections statewide: Portland, Maine. NCSL’s survey asked respondents to comment on whether other jurisdictions in their states used different equipment. The survey found that uniformity is fairly common among responding jurisdictions, with only one state—Minnesota—reporting that different equipment is used.
NCSL could not find any research indicating whether uniform election equipment is needed to conduct statewide elections using RCV. Of the two states using or implementing RCV statewide—Maine and Alaska—both do use the same equipment throughout each state. NCSL’s survey found that nearly all states with multiple localities using RCV also have uniform voting equipment. If a state permits county clerks to select their own election equipment and the state chooses to use RCV for statewide elections, the state legislature may seek to mandate minimum capacities for equipment certified for use in the state. Dialogue between legislators and election officials in your state would clarify exact needs, particularly if your state does not currently use the same equipment types statewide.
NCSL’s survey of local election officials asked a number of questions (see the Appendix) about many aspects of ranked choice voting implementation, including whether RCV increased the difficulty or number of ballot designs a jurisdiction needed to create. Of the 15 responses received, three are in the process of implementing RCV and have yet to design a ballot. Of the remaining twelve, five (42%) reported no increase in the number of ballot designs, while seven (58%) reported creating additional designs to conduct RCV elections. Some of those designs were due to other rules, such as a requirement that each office be listed on separate ballot pages, and thus were not due to RCV itself. Others reported difficulty designing ballots with a mix of RCV and non-RCV elections, because many jurisdictions only use RCV for select races.
The question about the time dedicated to ballot design was included to capture whether labor costs were higher, even if additional ballot designs ulitmately were not needed. Of those twelve responding jurisdictions, only two (17%) reported no additional time spent on design, five (41.5 %) reported a small increase in the amount of time required and the remaining five (41.5%) reported a significant increase in the amount of time required. A majority of LEOs said designing instructions for the newly created ballots was a significant hurdle. Multiple LEOs noted their vendors helped with the design process, and a handful noted they selected ballot design vendors specifically because of their experience with other jurisdictions using RCV.
According to NCSL’s survey, a majority of jurisdictions currently running RCV elections increased the number of ballot designs they produced when adopting RCV, and that the first RCV ballot design took more time than non-RCV ballot design. It appears some of those costs, such as crafting new ballot instructions, are one-time expenses, while others like longer ballot proofing times are likely to recur in each election. But despite this, a majority of jurisdictions reported these costs were either non-existent or minimal, rather than significant, and were likely to diminish over time.
NCSL’s survey of local election officials included a question on how their offices educated the public about RCV. Of the 15 responses received, three came from offices that are in the process of implementing RCV and have not yet conducted a RCV election. Of the remaining 12, one—Cambridge, Mass.—implemented RCV so long ago that the education efforts used at the time are unknown. The 11 remaining offices reported a variety of techniques, including:
- Educational flyers as inserts in absentee ballots sent to voters.
- Printing instructions on completing an RCV ballot on the ballot itself.
- Web dissemination, including through social media platforms like Facebook.
- Newspaper advertisements.
- Conducting a mock RCV election and inviting the public to participate.
- Holding informational sessions at community centers and other local events like farmers markets.
- Publishing a page on RCV on the local election office’s website.
- Producing videos on RCV in partnership with a public affairs company.
- Partnering with community organizations like the League of Women Voters.
- Special trainings on RCV for candidates running in those elections.
None of the local election officials surveyed said any specific public education effort was critical, nor did any report that their efforts were insufficient. Costs, including staff time, are addressed in other sections of this report.
In their 2019 paper, Self-Reported Understanding of Ranked Choice Voting , Todd Donovan, Caroline Tolbert and Kellen Gracey analyzed voters’ comprehension of voting instructions by system type in California (winner take all, top two, plurality winners and RCV). They found that with the exception of the state’s top-two system, nonwhite voters reported lower levels of comprehension than white voters, and the disparity was highest for RCV. When all survey respondents were considered, RCV had neither the lowest or highest comprehension rates among the four polled voting systems, and racial disparities existed across all voting system types. This lead the authors to conclude that to the extent any racial disparities existed with voter comprehension of RCV, those disparities were likely correlated with systemic disparities rather than any difficulty in understanding RCV. A report by New America found that voters understand RCV, despite critics’ claims to the contrary.
NCSL’s survey found that election offices use a myriad of methods to educate the public on RCV. None of the methods were described as either critical or unnecessary, which makes sense—most election offices merely seek to educate the public as best they can and do not audit their own techniques. While research on public education for RCV is limited, one study from California suggests racial and educational disparities in comprehending RCV could exist, and policymakers may want to pay close attention to how education efforts reach those groups. A 2019 study suggests that voters have little trouble making the switch from traditional voting systems to RCV. More research is needed to draw firmer conclusions on which techniques might best address those disparities.
To ensure that election equipment and procedures used to count votes during an election worked properly and the election yielded the correct outcome, many states require that election officials conduct a post-election audit. While the phrase can be used to mean a variety of election validation efforts, it generally refers to checking paper ballots or records against the results produced by the voting system to ensure accuracy. Although post-election audits may lead to a full recount if errors are detected, they differ from a recount in that they are conducted regardless of the margins of victory. Nearly all states require some form of post-election audit.
Until recently, few resources existed explaining how, specifically, ranked choice voting elections are best audited. A recent report from the Ranked Choice Voting Center explains how risk-limiting audits (RLAs) can be used in some types of RCV elections. Unlike traditional audits which count a percentage of ballots cast in each election, RLAs randomly select a small selection of ballots and hand count a specific race on those ballots. Counting continues until a level of statistical certainty about the accuracy of the count is reached. RLAs are used in a handful of states, though their use is increasing.
The Ranked Choice Voting Resource Center found existing software and technology can conduct an RLA in RCV elections that select a single winner, but not in RCV elections with multiple winners (e.g., a city council race where several offices are filled at once). Given that RLAs can be conducted in different ways, RCVRC recommends a technique that compares the paper ballot against the machine’s record for that ballot.
The Ranked Choice Voting Resource Center report on RLAs in RCV elections is the most comprehensive resource identified by NCSL. As requirements for more precise audit processes increase, and the use of RCV increases, the nexus of the two will likely be explored further either by election officials or researchers, or both.
Few studies on RCV look at more than one jurisdiction at a time. In fact, NCSL's original research did not find any multi-jurisdiction research on whether RCV might lead to more mistakes on the part of voters, which would lead to more ballots being rejected (or “spoiled”) and not counted. A new report from the Ranked Choice Voting Resource Center found that while variations in how RCV choices are presented to voters could impact ballot rejection rates, changing from one type of RCV to another led to the greatest increases in ballot rejection, highlighting the importance of public education efforts by election officials. Additionally, NCSL identified two single-jurisdiction case studies on the topic. The first analyzed a series of recent elections in San Francisco, which has used ranked choice voting for local offices since 2002. The 2015 paper by Francis Neely and Jason McDaniel found no statistically significant difference in spoilage between RCV and non-RCV elections. While they did find that racial minorities, older voters, poorer voters, women and voters who immigrated from another country had higher rates of ballot spoilage, those disparities existed regardless of election type. Across all elections they considered, while critics worry that voters will only mark their first choice candidate, this study found that voters were more likely to rank all candidates than to just mark their first or second choice. Voters were most likely to rank all candidates; the only exceptions were the 2006 board of supervisors’ race and the 2007 mayoral race, when a plurality of voters ranked only one or two choices. Neely and McDaniel concluded that any voters that did not rank every possible candidate did not do so because of so-called “ballot fatigue,” or exhaustion with deciphering voting rules that leads voters to cease filling out the ballot, and was instead either a misunderstanding of the rules or an intentional omission of lower rankings.
A more recent survey of 2020 Democratic primary voters found similar results. Joseph Coll’s study of 2020 Democratic primary voters offers valuable insight on ballot spoilage. Coll asked a sample of primary voters who cast RCV ballots to fill out a hypothetical ballot of his own design. He found that 12% of respondents did not rank all possible candidates, and that younger voters, racial minorities and women were more likely to rank fewer candidates than permitted—though many of those disparities were so small they may not be statistically significant.
Neither of the studies addressed potential differences between the residual vote rate or ballot rejection rate of in-person versus absentee ballots in RCV elections. While detailed instructions could be included with an absentee ballot mailed to voters, these voters lack the opportunity to ask an election judge for assistance. More research on this topic would be welcome.
Existing research on voter errors that may lead to ballot rejection focuses mainly on specific examples (voters in San Francisco and 2020 Democratic presidential primary voters whose state parties used RCV). While NCSL cannot draw conclusions from two isolated examples, their evidence is largely in agreement: in neither case did RCV itself trigger higher rates of voter errors, and any disparities that did exist between different groups of voters extended to non-RCV elections as well. Recent research from the Ranked Choice Voting Resource Center supports these findings, but additional peer-reviewed research would be helpful.
In NCSL’s survey of local election officials, of the 12 responding jurisdictions that have already implemented RCV, nine reported delays. These jurisdictions often used emphatic language to describe how delayed the results were. Three reported no delays.
The survey responses focus on two sources of delay: jurisdictions choosing not to run instant runoff until all ballots from all precincts are received, and that some tools like the Universal RCV Tabulator may not be certified to by regulators and thus cannot be used to produce unofficial election results. One jurisdiction noted that RCV ballots had higher rates of contested elections, and the resulting adjudication process further slowed the release of results. Many jurisdictions noted they aim to release RCV election results within 24 hours of polls closing, rather than the night of the election.
Some of the survey responses offered ideas on how to improve the process. One respondent said they did not begin tabulating RCV elections until the following morning, which was well known within the community. Another office suggested that regardless of a jurisdiction’s size, it should abandon hand tabulation of ballots and use mechanical tabulators with an instant runoff algorithm once all ballots are received. A different office suggested publishing the first through third choice votes on election night but waiting to run the official tabulation until the following day. One election office noted their post-election surveys found that voter dislike of delays was outweighed with satisfaction in the majority winners RCV produces.
One important caveat: it is not uncommon for some jurisdictions to post their first unofficial results the day after an election. In a blog on FairVote’s website , Rich Robinson noted that many jurisdictions that run RCV elections struggle to produce any results on election night, regardless of election type. Policymakers may want to consider the existing capacity of their local election offices to produce quick results when assessing the relative speed of RCV.
NCSL’s survey found that local election officials believe RCV delays the release of unofficial election results. Some respondents recommended changes to expedite the process, and others noted that voters reported satisfaction with RCV despite the delays. But with broad consensus that it does cause delays, policymakers may wish to weigh that against other factors when considering RCV legislation.
While NCSL’s survey of local election officials did not specifically ask how administrators can best adjust to RCV, there were many recommendations in survey responses. Summarized, these include:
- Pursuing multiple public education channels and methods to reach a wide swath of voters.
- Preparing the public for a potential delay in the release of election results.
- Educating candidates on how the RCV process works so they can be stewards of that information with the public.
- Speaking with vendors or consultants to assist with things like ballot design to reduce costs of adopting RCV.
Many pro-RCV organizations produce resources for election administrators to use. The Ranked Choice Voting Resource Center has an entire webpage dedicated to making adoption of RCV easier on administrators. FairVote maintain a similar webpage with resources on ballot designs, tabulation, and a sample RFP for RCV-capable equipment.
In addition to elections tech vendors, several organizations offer resources to election officials that may assist with adjusting to RCV. While some of these organizations expressly advocate for RCV, responses to NCSL’s survey indicate election officials use (or would like to use) these resources more than they currently do. Apart from outside resources, local election officials may find the most value in contact their peers who run elections using RCV. Even when unsolicited, many offered ideas on how adopting RCV could be easier for others in the future.
NCSL’s survey of local election officials conducting elections using ranked choice voting did not address how results are best shown for RCV elections, and so far no peer-reviewed research exists. The Center for Civic Design (CCD), a nonpartisan organization that provides insight on design for voting and other civic activities, addresses this question in Design Principles for Ranked Choice Voting . CCD recommends the following practices:
- When reporting results, show the winner before explaining the counting process.
- First, describe what happens in each round, then follow with a visual display.
- Show all rounds of counting. Include vote totals for each candidate, the number of votes removed or added, the number of inactive ballots, and a “goal line” for the winners.
- Make it easy to see the number of votes transferred to each candidate during each round.
- Show the number of ballots that are no longer being counted because all ranked candidates have been eliminated in the result list. Differentiate these ballots from the ones that still have votes for non-eliminated candidates.
- Make it easy for users to navigate both forward and back to see the process of counting.
CCD web resources include an interactive demonstration on how to display RCV results . Some local election offices dedicate websites to explaining RCV tabulation to the public in advance of election night.
The Ranked Choice Voting Resource Center (RCVRC) has a similar list of recommendations :
- Release a preliminary round-by-round tally on election night
- Countinue to release preliminary tallies as more votes are counted
- Conduct vote total checks with each release of preliminary results
- Publish the full ballot record so that anyone can verify the result
- Make use of tools for visualizing RCV results
- Clearly communicate expectations, timelines and results.
A 2019 paper by Bridget Eileen Tenner and Gregory Warrington recommends against using bar charts to visualize election results using RCV. They recommend any visualization of election results achieve the following objectives, irrespective of election type: (i) be easy to understand; (ii) clearly indicate a winner; (iii) reflect the methodology of the election; and (iv) summarize the ballots that were cast. They recommend accumulation charts , which show second-choice votes in a different color than first-place votes, as a possible solution.
As part of its commitment to nonpartisanship and avoiding taking positions on issues, NCSL does not recommend any best practices for showing RCV results. The Center for Civic Design recommends local election offices adopt several different practices to best visualize ranked choice voting results, as does the paper by Tenner and Warrington and the research from the Ranked Choice Voting Resource Center. Absent peer-reviewed research, these stand out among an otherwise quiet research area. Policymakers and election officials may look to jurisdictions already using RCV for additional inspiration or models.
Scant research exists on RCV’s impact on voter turnout, and most is anecdotal. The research that does exist offers mixed conclusions. Deloitte economist Eamon McGinn investigated whether the adoption of RCV in the Minneapolis-St. Paul region in 2009 impacted turnout in the cities’ municipal elections. He concluded that, when controlling for other variables, turnout rose nearly 10% . However, a similar study by political scientists David Kimball and Joseph Anthony concluded that while RCV does mitigate the significant drop off in turnout between primary elections and any subsequent runoffs by combining them into one election, impacts on turnout in non-runoff elections are negligible.
Proponents of RCV often point to international examples, such as Australia, to indicate the potential for increased turnout when switching from a plurality voting system to RCV. Australia offers a compelling comparative example to the United States: it is a fellow former English colony in the same common law tradition, and its settlement and migration patterns are similar. Unlike the United States, Australia has a strong tradition of high voter turnout. According to Pew , over 80% of Australians cast a ballot in the 2019 parliamentary elections, while just over 55% of Americans cast a ballot in the 2016 presidential election. But Australia’s compulsory voting laws and nearly century-long history of using RCV make a comparison challenging without further research controlling for these differences.
Because comparing elections across different jurisdictions can be challenging, a case study example from New York City is included to shed additional light on the topic. New York City is the most populous jurisdiction in the United States using RCV. Spurred by concerns over the costs of its primary election runoffs in municipal elections and significant runoff turnout decreases, the city council referred a measure to voters to use RCV in contested municipal primaries in future elections . It passed with over 73% of votes in favor and was implemented for the first time in 2021. While comparisons across years are anecdotal and do not control for other factors, they can provide insight into voter behavior and interest in the process. In 2013, the last open mayoral election conducted with first-past-the-post voting, 772,241 votes were cast. In 2021, the first mayoral election conducted with ranked choice voting, 998,000 votes were cast— a 22.6% increase .
While not directly related to the causal relationship between RCV and turnout, it should be noted that in areas of the country dominated by a single party using RCV can significantly increase turnout in decisive elections. For example, imagine a fictional county, which we will call Evergreen County. Evergreen County is dominated by Party A, whose candidates almost always win general elections by overwhelming margins over candidates from Party B. Because of this consistency, the most competitive election in the county for any given office is Party A’s primary. Because primary elections tend to have lower turnout than general elections, a relatively small number of voters in Party A’s primary effectively chooses the winner for every office in Evergreen County. Advocates argue that if primaries were eliminated and replaced with an all-comers general election using RCV, the number of voters participating in the outcome-determinative election would increase.
When compared with non-runoff plurality voting, existing research indicates minimal or indeterminate impacts on overall voter turnout. RCV appears to offer a small-to-moderate increase in turnout for primary runoff elections because the rates of spoilage and waste are cumulatively less than the decrease in turnout between a plurality election and a subsequent runoff. Anecdotal evidence from the Minneapolis-St. Paul region and New York City indicate greater turnout benefits are possible, and countries with widespread RCV use like Australia have significantly higher turnout than the average American election. This indicates that RCV’s impact on low-propensity voters may be minimal, to the extent it exists at all. But without controlling for other factors like mandatory voting laws and political culture differences, such anecdotal examples should be taken with a grain of salt.
Ranked choice voting is different. As seen in the administrative sections of this report, switching to RCV imposes transition costs on local jurisdictions that make the switch, although these are hard to quantify and may be offset by other factors, such as no longer needing to hold runoff elections. Voters face “costs” too because they must learn how to vote using the new method.
Disparate impacts on voters can be assessed by measuring the number of ballots where voters either choose more candidates than permitted or select fewer than permitted and their ballots are “exhausted,” or eliminated from counting in later runoff rounds. Election offices publish these statistics with general election results, enabling researchers to analyze their rates over time and across different types of voting systems. Because American elections use secret ballots, demographic data on who is casting these ballots does not exist. Only research using statistical tools like regression analyses can shed light on possible disparate impacts RCV may have on particular groups.
As one academic noted, choosing fewer candidates than permitted “is often attributed to voter fatigue, ballot confusion, or voter ignorance.” But not ranking some or all non-first choice preferences could be a conscious choice by voters, and research recommends not assuming this phenomenon results from voter mistakes or confusion. The best analysis was conducted by political scientist Joseph Coll. In his research on the 2020 Democratic primaries that used RCV, Coll surveyed 1000 voters on their experience voting ranked choice ballots. He found that 68.4% of primary voters said voting using RCV was very or somewhat easy, compared to just 19.7% of voters who said it was somewhat or very hard. He found that older voters were more likely to report difficulty voting using RCV, which falls in line with existing research. After applying a regression to the dataset, Call concluded that—despite expectations—the attribute associated with choosing fewer candidates than permitted is age. Absent this factor, there was no statistically significant difference between voters on partisanship (moderate versus liberal), gender or wealth.
While Call did not analyze race as a factor, a report from Todd Donovan, Caroline Tolbert and Kellen Gracey did. They concluded that while Black, Latino and Asian voters reported lower levels of understanding on how to vote using RCV, those disparate impacts closely mirror those groups’ lower comprehension of plurality voting systems, meaning lower minority group comprehension of RCV is likely due to factors unassociated with RCV.
The challenges posed by ranked choice voting do not differ greatly from those imposed by existing voting systems. Limited research indicates that while minority groups report lower levels of comprehension on how to vote using RCV, this lower understanding mirrors reduced comprehension rates in elections broadly. Socioeconomic status, relative partisan lean, and sex identification have not been shown to impact voters’ ability to successfully cast a ballot using RCV. Among all groups of voters, only age was tied to overvoting or ballot exhaustion.
Ranked choice voting proponents claim it solves many political ills. Perhaps none is as prominent as the claim that it decreases political polarization. By forcing candidates to compete for “second choice” votes, RCV recalibrates candidates’ incentives by rewarding broad appeal in the electorate with a greater likelihood of winning non-first choice votes, which could be the difference between the original first choice and the eventual winner. RCV’s impact on polarization inevitably varies on its use case (e.g., primary vs. general election), so this section will briefly survey the existing research.
The largest U.S. jurisdiction using RCV for general elections is Maine, which used RCV for federal elections in 2018 and 2020. While advocates point to the Pine Tree State as an example of RCV’s moderating tendencies, preliminary research suggests RCV had only a modest impact on reducing polarization. Analyzing the 2020 elections in Maine that used RCV, preliminary research indicates RCV did decrease polarization, but only modestly. In fact, Maine’s relative and longstanding political moderation compared with the rest of the U.S. accounted for much more of the state’s relatively low polarization in 2020. While the researchers did conclude RCV’s effect on reducing polarization exceeded traditional runoff voting systems, it fell short of its billing as a silver bullet.
While ignored in the administrative section of this report, ranked choice voting has found increasing traction in state primaries. More than 280,000 Democratic voters participated in ranked choice primaries in 2020 , and in 2021 the Virginia Republican Party used RCV to nominate its candidates for statewide office. Research indicates that the candidates emerging from these primaries had broader coalitions than some of their opponents, and the nominees in three cases—Democrat Joe Biden in 2020, New York mayor Democrat Eric Adams, and Virginia Republicans Glenn Youngkin, Winsome Sears, and Jason Miyares—all went on to general election victories. This has led some media outlets to conclude that, based on these limited cases, RCV does live up to advocates’ claims.
Per limited research, ranked choice voting modestly decreased political polarization in general elections in Maine, while it led to broadly appealing—and victorious—candidates emerging from some party primaries. New systems are emerging that merit more consideration, particularly Alaska's top-four primary that put all candidates on one ballot regardless of party, from which four candidates go on to the general election conducted with RCV. But there is no conclusive evidence as of today to suggest that RCV has a significant impact on polarization.
Ranked choice voting may change parties’ political incentives, but NCSL could not identify any research expressly analyzing whether RCV benefits one political party or another. Advocates claim this should not matter, that RCV is neutral and simply rewards whichever candidate offers the broadest appeal. Despite scant research, an academic paper from Maine does provide some insight.
In their analysis of the 2020 federal elections in Maine , Joseph Cerrone and Cynthia McClintock looked at a number of different aspects of RCV, including its effect on polarization, voter satisfaction with the system, and voter familiarity with RCV’s rules. In their satisfaction discussion, they note that Republican voters in Maine were highly dissatisfied with RCV because they followed political cues from the Maine Republican Party, which vehemently opposed RCV’s adoption in the state. The Maine Republican Party’s opposition was likely grounded in data: Cerrone and McClintock noted that Maine had a long history of Republican plurality winners due to minor party candidates receiving significant shares of general election votes that may have otherwise gone to Democratic candidates. These plurality winners were typically—but not always—Republican. Because RCV would allow these third-party voters to cast a second-choice vote for Democrats, they said, the system could be seen as more beneficial to Democrats than Republicans in the state.
RCV may benefit whichever party “loses” more potential votes to third party (or “spoiler”) candidates, though assuming whether Democrats or Republicans would automatically garner second- or third-place votes from third party voters in any given jurisdiction is fraught. More research in this areas is needed before drawing conclusions with a high degree of certainty.
Some advocates of ranked choice voting argue that primary elections may be the best way to use RCV. After all, primaries are semi-private operations by and for political parties, and are sometimes run by the parties themselves. According to FairVote , Democratic voters used RCV in primaries and caucuses in five states (Alaska, Nevada, Hawaii, Kansas, and Wyoming) in the 2020 presidential election. Since 2020, RCV has been used in Democratic and Republican party elections and conventions in Delaware, Indiana, Minnesota, Nebraska, New Mexico, Oklahoma, Utah and Virginia.
While most states set policy for primaries by statute, some states’ laws permit parties the flexibility to experiment with different nominating systems, including conducting party-run primaries using RCV. This could offer advocates a new way to introduce voters to the practice where politics or other factors may hinder its adoption in general elections.
There is another reason that RCV might be particularly useful in primary elections: it is a way to whittle down a large candidate field to just the one who will go on to the general election, while ensuring that they have wide support. In fact, RCV ensures that the winner has support from a majority of voters.
RCV is also used by some of the states that employ a primary runoff system. There, a majority of votes is required to win a primary, and a runoff will occur if no candidates receive 50% + 1 votes in the first election. Six of those states—Arkansas, Alabama, Georgia, Louisiana, Mississippi and South Carolina—use RCV to ensure that overseas voters have a voice in a primary runoff; if no runoff occurs, the ranked ballots are not tabulated, and the voter’s first choice is counted as their vote. This method saves time and money by not requiring a ballot to be mailed out and mailed back to the election office within the time window required by the Uniform and Overseas Citizens Absentee Voting Act, commonly known as UOCAVA.
NCSL takes no position on the wisdom of adopting RCV or adopting it in some circumstances versus others. When most people think about the adoption of RCV, they think of Maine and Alaska which have adopted it for the general elections for major offices. But RCV exists in many specialized situations in other states, either for certain types of ballots (like those for overseas voters) or certain types of nominating processes, whether they be party-run primaries, caucuses or conventions. These uses indicate that even if a state does not wish to adopt RCV for statewide or municipal elections, there may be particular use cases that are of interest to policymakers.
Except for Maine and Alaska, ranked choice voting in the United States is used exclusively at the local level. Some states, including Virginia and Utah, have adopted laws explicitly allowing localities to use RCV for local elections if they choose. But absent such a specific grant of authority, how does existing authority between states and localities influence a locality’s ability to adopt RCV on its own?
The 10th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution expressly reserves all unenumerated rights to the states; it makes no mention of local governments. Decades of judicial and statutory evolution have led most states to adopt the position that absent a broad delegation of power, localities may only exercise the powers expressly granted to them by the state. This is known as “Dillon’s Rule.” To give localities more flexibility, some states have adopted so-called “ home rule ” laws that permit cities and counties autonomy over certain areas of policy. The specific parameters of home rule vary from state to state. Only nine states lack constitutional or statutory systems to create home rule: Alabama, Idaho, Indiana, Maryland, Mississippi, New York, Rhode Island, Vermont, and Virginia.
Even if state law allows localities to adopt ranked choice voting, or they may adopt it under home rule, other factors may come into play. If states procure election equipment on behalf of localities, or if their voting systems requirements limit what systems counties may procure, the supplied machines and technology could lack the ability to run an election using RCV. Many states’ home rule laws are least permissive on fiscal affairs, so localities may have little wiggle room to make the procurements necessary to switch to RCV. The Ranked Choice Voting Resource Center has analyzed the legal feasibility of adopting RCV in all 50 states as part of its “RCV Maps” project.
Conclusion
Several factors impact a city, town or county’s ability to adopt RCV for local elections. By determining the answers to the following questions, localities can ascertain whether they can adopt RCV:
- Does state law expressly permit (or prohibit) localities from adopting RCV?
- Absent on-point guidance, does state law grant home rule to localities?
- If state law grants home rule to localities, does it include the ability to adopt a voting system?
Depending on the answer to question 1, and if “yes” is the answer to questions 2 and 3, a jurisdiction likely has the legal authority to adopt RCV; an in-state attorney will be able to give a definitive answer, although consult an attorney before proceeding. Legal hurdles aren’t the only thing deciding factor; jurisdictions will still face the financial costs in labor, materials, and equipment procurement.
FairVote, an organization which advocates for the widespread adoption of ranked choice voting, maintains a webpage on alternatives to RCV. These alternatives are:
- Range voting , also known as score voting, where voters assign a value to each candidate within a defined range such as 1-10. According to FairVote, it has never been used in a public election and is used infrequently by private associations.
- Approval voting , which allows voters to vote, or “approve,” as many candidates as they wish. It is currently used for municipal elections in Fargo, North Dakota and St. Louis, Missouri.
- Condorcet-type rules , also known as Condorcet voting, allows voters to rank candidates in order of preference and the candidate with the most positive relative associations—that is, the one who compares best to their competitors—wins the election. It is a different method for tabulating a ranked ballot and shares many similarities to RCV as it exists in the United States, though for many voters the experience of casting a ballot is the same.
Of these alternatives, range voting has little literature and less traction with the public, making a comparative case next to impossible. Condorcet-type rules are merely a different method of counting ranked ballots, one in which, unlike with RCV, a candidate with no first-place votes could—in theory—emerge victorious. Of these alternatives, only approval voting receives significant attention, and even then, it is scant.
Proponents of approval voting argue it has comparative advantages over RCV , including simpler ballot design and easier (and quicker) tabulation of results. Proponents of RCV argue that approval voting fails to guarantee majority rule, is susceptible to strategic voting because of the incentive to vote for only a single candidate to avoid diluting the vote, and does not require a core level of support to win an election, unlike in RCV where first place votes play a critical role in winning.
Beyond policy debates, some alternative voting systems may be more workable under existing state law than others. Take Maine for example. In 2016, voters approved a ballot measure to adopt RCV for state legislative, executive, and federal offices. But the state supreme court unanimously ruled the provisions of the Maine Constitution requiring that state officeholders be elected by plurality meant that RCV, which prohibits plurality victories, could not proceed for those offices. While additional legal guidance would be necessary to further assess the situation, approval voting does not necessarily require majority support for a candidate to win and may be more compatible for state offices under their existing constitutional framework.
While many alternatives to RCV exist, only approval voting has any traction in the United States—and its adoption is a distant second behind RCV among alternatives to plurality voting systems. Proponents of both systems argue theirs is superior to the other. In the end, state laws and constitutions may bar one alternative or the other from being used in a particular state. Legislators and others should consult counsel to determine if any legal barriers exist to their preferred system’s implementation before proceeding with legislation—unless, of course, the legislation remedies the legal barrier.
Risk comes in many different flavors. Physical security is front and center in many recent debates on elections . Other risks include difficulty in casting a ballot and potential voter confusion about how the system operates. The question is, does RCV introduce unique security issues despite RCV and plurality election jurisdictions using the same kinds of equipment?
In very rare circumstances, small jurisdictions using RCV may tabulate ballots by hand, which can be time consuming and difficult to scale up for wider adoption. By far most jurisdictions use electronic tabulators certified by the U.S. Election Assistance Commission. While the risk of external manipulation is greater than zero, it is no greater in an election where RCV is used than any other election. The Ranked Choice Voting Resource Center , a prominent organization that conducts original research on RCV, recommends using machines to tabulate ranked ballots because they can deliver unofficial results more rapidly. In general, NCSL did not find any research suggesting that the software, machines or other equipment associated with RCV poses a greater or unique cybersecurity risk than plurality elections.
Cybersecurity is a key issue election officials face when crafting policies and procedures to safeguard voting. While adopting RCV for the first time carries risks inherent with adopting any new procedures, NCSL could not find any research or evidence suggesting the tools and methods used to conduct RCV carry greater risks than traditional, plurality elections.",source_text/2caaeab0c36f4de5ff946f1f43bac95b884dadb8474c78d9a54938bedde493c2-perplexity_0_2.txt,RCV combines the general election and the runoff by letting voters select—or “rank”—the candidates in order of preference.,complete_support,False,song - sang - wrote - sings - movie - played - plays - blood - released - original,StanfordCitation,0.58,0.5633333333333334,0.56,0.55,[0.8313674330711365],[0.8313674330711365]

It isn't uncommon to wind down a night with a cocktail in hand and friends all around on the weekend. And most of the time, you don't have to think twice about this consumption. While drinking alcohol in moderation is generally not a cause for concern (and may have benefits ), when your imbibing starts to become a daily habit, Mayo Clinic doctors warn that you might want to take a closer look at how much you drink and how that alcohol can affect your health.
""Occasional beer or wine with dinner, or a drink in the evening, is not a health problem for most people. When drinking becomes a daily activity, though, it may represent progression of your consumption and place you at increased health risks,"" Terry Schneekloth, MD , a doctor of psychiatry and addiction at the Mayo Clinic, said in a 2018 Q&A.
Even if it's just one glass of wine (5 ounces) or beer (12 ounces) or cocktail (1.5 ounces) or hard malt seltzer (8 ounces) every night, in some instances, that's considered ""heavy drinking.""
According to the Mayo Clinic , ""Heavy or high-risk drinking is defined as more than three drinks on any day or more than seven drinks a week for women and for men older than age 65 (that's just one drink a day)."" For men under the age of 65, heavy drinking is defined as ""more than four drinks on any day or more than 14 drinks a week.""
""Alcohol can damage your body's organs and lead to various health concerns. For women, this damage happens with lower doses of alcohol, because their bodies have lower water content than men. That's why the moderate drinking guidelines for women and men are so different,"" says Dr. Schneekloth.
Before you pour another drink, you should probably be aware of those common health effects Dr. Schneekloth is referring to. This is why we've reviewed all the information the Mayo Clinic provides on the side effects of drinking alcohol every day. If any of these symptoms sound familiar, know that it may be time to cut back on booze. Read on, and for more on healthy eating, don't miss 11 Amazing Side Effects of Eating a Banana Every Day .

Drinking too much alcohol puts you at risk of several neurological issues, for multiple reasons. For starters, ""alcohol is a neurotoxin that can disrupt communications of the brain,"" says the Mayo Clinic . ""It also affects functions of brain cells directly and indirectly through different organ dysfunction from alcohol usage and vitamin deficiency. Abusing alcohol can lead to seizure, stroke, and dementia, to name a few conditions. Additionally, alcohol is toxic to a developing brain during pregnancy and can cause birth defects, including developmental disorders with lifelong impact.""

Alcohol is metabolized by the liver, where an enzyme known as alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH) breaks it down. Because of the burden of processing on this organ, consuming alcohol in excess can result in many liver problems. In addition to increasing your risk of liver cancer, your liver is at risk of other health issues from drinking alcohol in excess every day. Drinking too much ""increases your risk of cirrhosis — a serious liver disorder,"" says Donald Hensrud, MD , a doctor of Preventive Medicine at the Mayo Clinic .
3
""Drinking too much can increase your risk for a host of cancers, including liver, stomach, breast, colon, and oral cancer,"" according to Dr. Hensrud.
4
Alcohol causes the pancreas to produce toxic substances, and as a result, ""[drinking too much] raises the likelihood that you could develop inflammation in your pancreas [known as pancreatitis] and in the lining of your stomach,"" according to Dr. Hensrud.
5
""All told, drinking alcohol in excess is the third-leading cause of preventable death in the United States,"" says Dr. Hensrud.
6
""Drinking too much alcohol can raise blood pressure to unhealthy levels,"" says Sheldon G. Sheps, MD , emeritus professor of medicine and former chair of the Division of Nephrology and Hypertension in the Department of Medicine at Mayo Clinic. ""Having more than three drinks in one sitting temporarily increases your blood pressure, but repeated binge drinking can lead to long-term increases."" Alcohol can also increase your blood pressure through other longer-term measures: ""Keep in mind that alcohol contains calories and may contribute to unwanted weight gain — a risk factor for high blood pressure.""
7
When you drink alcohol every day, you put yourself at risk of developing an addiction. As it relates to alcohol, this addiction is known as alcohol use disorder, ""which includes a level that's sometimes called alcoholism,"" explains the Mayo Clinic .
""Alcoholism develops over time as people get into a habit. As tolerance for alcohol increases, consumption often rises as well. You need to be cautious not to fall into bad habits with alcohol, because the consequences can be severe,"" says Dr. Hensrud. ""I suggest to the people I see in my practice that they go at least a couple of days a week without alcohol, or that they take a break from alcohol for periods of time, as a reality check to make sure they are not becoming dependent on it.""
8
The Mayo Clinic notes that excessive drinking may lead to heart muscle damage (alcoholic cardiomyopathy) leading to heart failure. Dr. Hensrud adds that ""too much alcohol may raise your blood pressure and triglyceride levels. Both can put you at higher risk for heart disease.""

HOUSTON—Two big stories here when I landed from Vegas:
- Drafting a franchise quarterback.
- Paying franchise-quarterback draft capital to draft a defensive end.
There’s no other way to put it: After picking C.J. Stroud second overall, the Texans traded up nine slots, from 12 to three in the first round, to take Alabama defensive end Will Anderson . Houston GM Nick Caserio traded 12 and 34 this year and first- and third-round picks next year to just barely squeeze the trade into the NFL’s 10-minute window for the third pick. As I explain in the next item about Arizona’s draft, Houston could be picking very early next year—which will put a white hot spotlight of pressure on Anderson.
Caserio told me at NRG Stadium that Stroud was clearly the team’s target at two. He’d had some discussions with Cards GM Monti Ossenfort about possibly moving from 12 to three. “Then,” Caserio said, “it happened pretty quickly when they were on the clock.”
The deal got done and all parties notified, he said, with “close to a minute” left. So the Texans got a player they hope will be their franchise QB, and they got the best defensive player on their board. That is one heck of a night’s work. The price, of course, is denuding the 2024 draft when the Texans might wish they had two first-round picks and four in the first three rounds—instead of now just one first-round pick, one second- and no thirds.
But – and there is a big but – you should have been at the Texans’ facility in the basement of NRG Stadium late Friday afternoon, when Stroud and Anderson put on a show of humility and team-firstness that had to make Texans fans so weary of losing (a league-worst 11-38-1 in the last three years) happy for the first time since the Wild Card win over Buffalo three years ago.
Stroud and Anderson came with their families and made it clear they were all-in on going to a losing team after years of nothing but winning in college. Afterward, Stroud told me: “That’s what life is about, working to build something good. That’s what I’m here to help this team do. I’m ready for it.”
The Texans have asked Stroud to let the S-2 Test controversy go, but he got a couple last licks in on it. A player who played the way Stroud did—particularly in putting up 41 points in his superb final college game in the playoff against Georgia—is not a player who can’t process, or can’t ID a defense. I understand using every tool in the bag to analyze players before the draft, and I’d check out why Stroud scored low on the test. But to think it’s a good indicator of future failure—I mean, watch the games he’s played.
We stood in a hallway just off the Texans’ locker room for 12 minutes and I asked him about what he’s learned from the last three months.
“Humility is something I’m not afraid of,” Stroud said. “It’s something I’m accustomed to. This was all probably just a humble moment God wanted me to go through.
“ A lot of people haven’t played the sport, and I mean critics are gonna critique. For me I know the film speaks for itself. Everything that I’ve done in college, I’ve been very consistent. I think I’ve been one of the most consistent players in college football for the last two years. If you turn on the tape, you can see, you can answer the questions. But those who don’t understand tape might want to go to other things and analyze other things. They’re more than welcome to do such. But the people who are making the choices and the picks, they knew what I can do. They understood the IQ that I do have.
“I have a great memory when it comes to football,” Stroud added. “I feel like there’s different ways to be geniuses. You don’t just have to be book smart. You can be analytics smart. You can be numbers smart. You can be football smart. I really think that there’s different types of ways to be smart. That’s something that I pride myself on. And I am book smart. I did have over a 3.0 in college. I had over a 3.0 in high school. I know that I can think. I can process very, very fast. The film, you can see me going from first option to second and then back to one and then to three to four if I have to. I can check down. I can use my feet.
“But, you know, everything happens for a reason. I’m not upset. I’m actually blessed, I’m super blessed to be a Texan. Number two overall pick in the NFL draft, man. A little kid from the [California] Inland Empire. All smiles, man. I ain’t tripping about this.”
Good attitude to have. But at the same time, I could feel it: C.J. Stroud will remember this pre-draft process. And for the Texans, that bit of motivation will be a very good thing.
HENDERSON, Nev.—Just before noon on Thursday, hours before the start of the NFL Draft, Raiders coach Josh McDaniels popped into GM Dave Ziegler ’s office for one last bit of strategy talk. The team’s draft board had been set with finality Wednesday, after three months of debate. The Raiders, after conversations with teams above them about trading up from number seven in the first round, decided to stay in their slot, barring a surprise.
“What we need is for three quarterbacks to go before we pick,” McDaniels said.
It seemed logical, with Carolina going Bryce Young at number one and then Houston at two and Indianapolis at four and Seattle at five all in the QB market. But nothing in this draft after Carolina was a sure thing. All McDaniels and Ziegler knew was that these four non-QBs sat at the top of their board a short spiral away, graded closely:
But as Ziegler and McDaniels hashed it out, and McDaniels talked about the latest intel he’d heard about the top six (“I hope I’ll have something coming in on Houston at two, but Nick’s tight,” he said, referring to Texans GM/CIA agent Nick Caserio ), they realized they were just like the rest of America: They doubted Houston would pick a quarterback at two, they didn’t know which GM was fixing to pay a ransom to trade up with Arizona at three, they didn’t know which quarterback Indianapolis would choose at four, and they didn’t know if Seattle would go QB or best defensive weapon at five.
No surprise, all this mystery. This is the modern draft, where lips are no longer loose, where mock drafts are a mockery of reality. It sounds counterintuitive, but in the hours before the NFL Draft, the people running drafts for $6 billion franchises didn’t know much more than the rest of us. Ziegler and McDaniels did know by staying put—and they would get a phone call that surprised and tempted them minutes before their pick—they were not in control of their fate. They needed help. The Raiders needed two teams post-Carolina to pick passers in the next five picks. Likely. Not certain.
At 4:43 p.m. Pacific Time, Ziegler was on his way into the draft room, a large square conference room on the third floor of the Raiders’ facility six miles west of the Vegas Strip. He stopped by the floor-to-ceiling photograph of the man who lords over this franchise 12 years after his death, and Ziegler patted the photograph of Al Davis .
“Goosebumps,” Ziegler said. “I feel his presence every day.”
Then Ziegler—47, in gray suit, black Oxford shirt, no tie, white and black sneakers—entered the draft room, where 13 scouts, personnel people, one coach and one owner would plot the immediate future of Al Davis’ team. At 4:59 p.m., 11 minutes before the draft kicked off, owner Mark Davis slipped into the room, in his white satin Raiders jacket and stonewashed faded jeans.
“Gameday, baby!” Son of Al announced to the room.
Gameday, as Mark Davis said. “We’re still undefeated!” Davis said as Roger Goodell kicked off the draft. One wall taken up entirely with the draft board, ranking the players by position from top to bottom, on magnetic cards, the old-school way. One wall, controlled by pro personnel director Dwayne Joseph , with pick-by-pick order and team-by-team needs that change with every pick. One wall, which McDaniels, Ziegler, assistant GM Champ Kelly and Davis face, with three things: a big TV tuned to the draft, computerized pick-by-pick directly from the league, so it’s faster than what you see on TV, and a constantly updated list of trade discussions with draft-trade charts showing trade proposals broken down by a value chart.
Kelly, Ziegler (cell phone to his ear at least half of the evening), McDaniels, Davis, left to right in front of the room, in swivel chairs, able to look ahead at trade possibilities or back at the state of the draft board. Ziegler flitted from senior personnel adviser Shaun Herock to McDaniels to Davis to Kelly to director of football analytics David Christoff to senior national scouts DuJuan Daniels, Andy Dengler and Lenny McGill , having mostly hushed conversations.
5:18 p.m. PT: Panthers picked Young. “This is where the draft starts,” Ziegler, stating the obvious, said.
Four minutes later, the tinny voice from draft headquarters said, “Houston has made its pick. Arizona now on the clock.” All eyes turn to the board where the pick will show up first. C.J. Stroud , QB, Ohio State popped onto the screen. “Oooooh,” someone in the room said. Seven minutes passed. Arizona traded down to 12 with Houston. Big compensation: For this pick and a fourth- this year, the Texans gave the Colts the 12 th and 33 rd overall picks this year and their first- and third-round picks next year.
5:32 p.m.: Will Anderson to Houston at three. One Vegas target down.
5:33 p.m.: Ziegler on his cell, briefly. Ziegler to McDaniels in a hushed tone: “Arizona wants to trade back up.”
Ziegler and McDaniels stared at the trade-value board in the back of the room, analyzing trade possibilities—the values, plus or minus for the Raiders, based on the numerical values Ziegler assigns to each pick:
1-7 down to 1-12
Potential Counters
+177 ARI sends 2-33, LV gives back 4 th (109)
+68 ARI sends 2-33 and 6-213, LV gives back 3-100 and 4-109
+30 ARI sends 2-33, LV gives back 3-70
At 5:37 p.m., Anthony Richardson , the Florida quarterback, got picked by the Colts. The third quarterback was off the board. McDaniels beamed. He and Ziegler slapped hands. Now the Raiders were sure to get one of their four guys.
5:42 p.m.: Cards GM Monti Ossenfort called Ziegler. Hushed discussion, presumably exchanging potential offers for the pick. Then Ziegler and McDaniels huddled. Having the 12 th and 33 rd overall picks, to go along with the Raiders’ 38 th choice, would be tempting. “We could get [Oklahoma tackle Anton] Harrison at 12,” McDaniels said. The Raiders loved Harrison—not as much as Johnson, but enough maybe to lose the fourth non-QB they love in order to pick up the 33 rd pick. They mulled.
The phone went cold for a few minutes. Seemed obvious Ossenfort wanted Paris Johnson . He had to be dealing with Detroit, trying to get ahead of Vegas to ensure getting Johnson. Smart move by Ossenfort, choosing not to close a deal for the seventh pick and instead dealing for the sixth–ensuring that the Cards would get the tackle they wanted.
5:47 p.m.: Witherspoon to Seattle at five. Detroit up. No action on Ziegler’s phone. Not surprising. Arizona was targeting Johnson.
5:50 p.m.: Tinny voice from Draft HQ: “Detroit has traded its pick to Arizona. Arizona is on the clock.” For Vegas, there goes day-one starting right tackle Paris Johnson.
5:54 p.m. Paris Johnson to Arizona. “Las Vegas is on the clock,” tinny voice says.
So no real drama. The plan was preordained. There was no real debate now, no discussion about moving. Only this:
5:58 p.m.: “Tyree, this is coach McDaniels. We’re gonna turn the pick in here, and you’re gonna be a Raider.”
In a lull in front of the room, McDaniels said quietly: “Our board was right. We needed three quarterbacks to go, and we’re so happy we got one of the four non-quarterbacks who were our top-rated guys on the board. Look, we gotta rush the passer. We gotta go get [ Patrick] Mahomes and [ Justin] Herbert . That’s four games a year for the next few years against these great young quarterbacks. And the AFC is full of these great young quarterbacks. This is a great outcome for us.”
This is the draft. The Raiders needed long-term help opposite Maxx Crosby (edge player Chandler Jones is 33), and Anderson or Wilson would have been great. Witherspoon would have been great to add to a needy secondary. Johnson would have been great to bookend Kolton Miller . It’s capricious. The choice wasn’t up to Ziegler; other teams decided for him. But the vibe in the room, the smiles, showed this staff loves Wilson, even with the foot injury that made him an iffy candidate to some teams.
In his office 20 minutes later, McDaniels waited to be connected to Wilson to converse. “I mean, hallelujah,” McDaniels said. “His motivation, his drive, how he handles adversity … off the charts. We value the TAP test (a test in the pre-draft process that measures mental toughness, drive and composure under pressure), and Tyree got one of the highest grades on it, a Green plus-plus. He’ll fit in great here.”
McDaniels’ football ops guy, Tom Jones , walked in with a phone. Wilson. “Tyree, welcome to the nation,” McDaniels said. “Dude, I am so excited you’re a Raider. I know you’re gonna help us win a lot of games. So, just wanted to touch base on a few things. You’re gonna talk to the media here in a bit. Wanted to give you a few points. Be humble, which you are. Stay away from predictions—that way, you won’t have to eat them later. Don’t talk about timelines with your foot. You don’t want your draft story to be all about your foot. Now, you got a fan base that’s second to none. They’re gonna love you. Just express how excited you—which I know you are.”
Back in the Raiders draft room, after pick 19, Ziegler said, “Josh, you wanna look at trades?” On the board were four players with similar grades: Georgia defensive end Nolan Smith , Maryland corner Deonte Banks , Harrison the Oklahoma tackle, and Arkansas linebacker Drew Sanders . Close to them: Notre Dame tight end Michael Mayer .
But there wasn’t much enthusiasm to deal after Banks and Harrison went off the board. Ziegler made a couple of calls about moving up to fill a hole left by the trade of tight end Darren Waller with Mayer, but never got far—or appeared enthusiastic to do it.
7:36 p.m.: Crosby sent a video message to Wilson, and in the draft room, Ziegler had it and he showed it to McDaniels and Davis on his phone. The tenor of the message: Congrats, Tyree. Now, time to go work, son. “Love it,” McDaniels said.
There are lulls in all drafts, and after Banks and Harrison went at 24 and 27, this was the Raider lull. Davis kept things interesting. When the TV showed a crestfallen Will Levis , undrafted, still in the green room in Kansas City, he said: “Someone should tell him careers are not made on draft day. Tell him this happened to Aaron Rodgers too.” And when he looked up and saw speedy Jalin Hyatt , the wide receiver, still on the board with a high Raider grade, Davis said to McDaniels: “Too bad we don’t have a need at receiver. Can he run?”
“Like the wind,” McDaniels said.
Davis started laughing, like he could sense Ziegler and McDaniels did not want him to start lobbying for the best speed receiver in the draft.
“It’s part of my DNA,” Davis said. “I see a fast receiver, I want him. I can’t help it.” Spoken like his father’s son.
As the round wound down, quietly, I asked Davis what he thought of Ziegler and McDaniels, the ex-Pats, entering year two of their regime. “I like ‘em,” he said. “When we hired them, everybody thought we were trying to re-create the Patriots. That wasn’t it. I was trying to find two great football men. Now, this is their chance to build something. They’re young, they love football, and I’m thrilled with them. It’s a huge weekend for them.
“My dad’s drafts were different—a lot more tense.”
“The tense conversations were already had,” McDaniels said later. “We had them in the last six weeks. We ended up with the board where we all felt it needed to be.”
8:30 p.m.: Two picks left, including Kansas City at 31. Mayer on the mind in the draft room. “If KC comes back to us,” Ziegler said, “wanna do it?”
“Yes,” said McDaniels.
“Best tight end in the draft,” Kelly said.
Short conversation with KC. “Not gonna work,” Ziegler said. KC would have given 31 and 217 (sixth round) for 38 and 70, a net on the points chart of minus-147. “Too many players we like,” Ziegler said. (Ziegler, on Friday, traded from 38 to 35 with the Colts to snag Mayer, the tight end Vegas wanted above all.)
An hour after the round ended, McDaniels and Ziegler unwound in the draft room. Wilson underwent surgery by the top athletic foot surgeon in the field, Dr. Robert Anderson, to repair a fracture last Nov. 21. Six weeks ago, Anderson sent a letter to each team, saying Wilson has responded “extremely well” to surgery. The Raiders expect Wilson to be ready to play this season on schedule. “Our doctors ultimately felt like it was something that we were going to be okay with,” Ziegler said. “If we wouldn’t have felt comfortable with it, we wouldn’t have [picked Wilson].”
In all, the needy Raiders, trying to rebound from a few years of failed top picks, got two likely starters out of the draft—Wilson and Mayer. After that, it’s up in the air, as all drafts are. The Raiders got their presumptive backup to Jimmy Garoppolo , Aidan O’Connell , in the middle of the fourth round—about two rounds earlier than the consensus of where he deserved to go. They got a speed cornerback, Banks’ teammate Jakorian Bennett , with pick 104, and the Raiders hope he plays early.
Mel Kiper, for one, liked the first two picks but the others, not so much. After the top two, Kiper said, “I don’t see value with the rest of this class.”
That’s why they play the games. In three years, we’ll see if Ziegler picked right in the NFL’s 88 th draft.",source_text/f54b5e5941292efc5c40eeff153912bd53dcdecc06b76c3348b3ce8193c0cddb-neeva_0_0.txt,"Brady’s seven Super Bowl victories are the most by any player in NFL history, and it’s nearly double that of any other quarterback who has played.",complete_support,False,super - bowl - rams - 2021 - cowboys - raiders - chargers - nfl - dallas - 2015,StanfordCitation,0.58,0.5599999999999999,0.58,0.52,[0.5786152482032776],[0.5786152482032776]

The British national anthem is unique among some other national anthems in that its lyrics are variable depending upon the situation. Specifically, when a queen is on the throne, it's called ""God Save The Queen,"" and feminine pronouns (such as ""send her victorious"") are used throughout. When a king is on the throne — for example, the current King Charles III — it's called ""God Save The King"" and uses masculine pronouns.
And although American schoolchildren are unlikely to ever be put upon to sing the British national anthem specifically, they've been singing the song, albeit with different lyrics, for a couple of centuries now. That's because ""My Country 'Tis of Thee"" — which isn't the official national anthem here but is one of many patriotic songs we all learn as kids — has exactly the same melody, according to the Library of Congress . If this sounds like an example of upstart colonists taking something from their colonial masters and making it their own in order to troll the Crown, that's because that's exactly what happened. Sort of. The truth about why ""My Country 'Tis of Thee"" and ""God Save The King"" are the same melody is a hair more complicated.

According to History Today , it's not clear when the melody to ""God Save The King"" was written, but the Library of Congress points to a possible origin in the 17th century. Nevertheless, the song exploded (in England, anyway) in 1745. That the melody worked as a national anthem was not lost on the Danish, who used it as a basis for theirs by 1790.
It's not clear how or when the melody made its way across the pond, but get there it did, and soon enough, an American was setting his own words to the music. Not a big deal, because at the time, copyright enforcement was minimal, if not nonexistent; further, there was precedent for other countries using the song, considering the Danish had also made it their own. As Ben's Guide to the U.S. Government notes, that American was Samuel Francis Smith, and he put pen to paper in 1831. A while later, children's choirs were singing it, and the rest, as they say, is history.
Whether or not Smith put patriotic American lyrics to a British song as a deliberate ""screw you"" to England or whether he simply liked the tune is unclear. Either way, the song is an extension of George Bernard Shaw's famous claim that the U.S. and U.K. are ""two countries separated by a common language."" Shaw could also have said that they are two countries separated by a common anthem.",source_text/dfdf533b2094e18951c2bfe3a70f2ec3d97e794e37acad4bd86a5293ee73d4d0-bing_chat_0_0.txt,"Specifically, when a queen is on the throne, it's called ""God Save The Queen,"" and feminine pronouns (such as ""send her victorious"") are used throughout.

Fans of parliamentary government have long touted the notion that the British political system could — at least in theory — never get deadlocked in quite the same way as the American system, in which executive and legislative deadlock has become something of a signature feature.
But this week, the story looks different, as the United Kingdom is currently bogged down in an intractable deadlock between the executive and legislative branches of government over how to approach the looming deadline for Brexit.
First, Prime Minister Theresa May was unable to secure a parliamentary majority for her preferred approach to Brexit, which led to her resignation and replacement by current Prime Minister Boris Johnson.
But Johnson can no more secure a majority for his approach than May could, and his determination to try to push forward anyway has generated a week of political crisis. He decided to “prorogue” — that is, temporarily suspend — Parliament for a few weeks in order to shrink the time it had to come up with legislation to thwart his plans. But that prompted a member of his Conservative Party to defect to the centrist Liberal Democrats, costing Johnson his already minuscule parliamentary majority.
Then enough Conservative MPs joined with the opposition parties to take control of the parliamentary agenda from Johnson, setting them up to pass a bill that would explicitly constrain him on Brexit. Johnson, in an effort to get the MPs in line, wants to hold a fresh election that he thinks will give him a majority of like-minded parliamentarians.
But at the moment, it looks like he’s not going to get what he wants and Parliament is going to pass measures over his opposition.
It’s something that looks much more like an American-style “separation of powers” system than the traditional British fusion of power. The American system has fewer wild swings in policy trajectory but also makes the total breakdown of the political system that is possible in the US common. It’s something that is inconceivable in Latin American countries or under a Westminster-style Parliament — at least in theory.
The UK’s problem today is the consequence of a 2011 law that was passed to address a particular set of circumstances but has turned out to have wide-ranging implications for a variety of situations — including introducing the novelty of deadlocks into a system that is not accustomed to them.
The UK famously lacks a written constitution.
But an old quip has it that you can sum up the whole thing with eight words: “What the Queen-in-Parliament enacts is law.”
Initially, Parliament evolved as an institution that existed to check and balance the power of the monarch. And the American political system operates on a kind of analogy to that 18th-century version of British institutions, with the president playing the role of the king (or queen), the Senate the role of the House of Lords, and the House of Representatives the role of the House of Commons.
Over time, however, the Lords were stripped of almost all their real power and a new tradition developed in which the queen would act exclusively on the advice of her prime minister. The prime minister, however, is elected by the House of Commons rather than directly by the voters.
All powers, in other words, are effectively held by the parliamentary majority party.
The queen appoints the leader of the majority party in Parliament as her prime minister; the prime minister decides which bills Parliament votes on; and then those bills are granted the queen’s royal assent on the advice of the prime minister.
Members of the majority party are rarely if ever unanimous in their views, but as party leader, the prime minister can kick them out of the party if they won’t do what he wants. (Johnson says this will happen to the members of his Conservative Party who defied him.) And, more importantly, traditionally the prime minister can dissolve Parliament and call a new election (or, formally speaking, “advise” the queen to do this).
The prime minister might lose the election, of course, and thus not get what he or she wants. The prime minister also might harbor ambitions that his or her colleagues in Parliament advise are politically untenable — and they may warn the prime minister that they won’t vote for his or her ideas, and thus that insisting on them will trigger an election campaign he or she will lose.
In other words, it’s not a dictatorship where the PM can just do whatever. Mass opinion, the opinion of the members of Parliament, and the interplay between the two play a critical role in shaping outcomes. But you never have a standoff — either the PM gets what they want or there’s a new election, which they either win or lose.
Implicitly underlying this, however, was the presumption that the UK’s election system would deliver something approximating two-party politics with strong majorities. But then everything started to change.
The UK uses a “first past the post” electoral system just like the United States. This means that whichever candidate in a race gets the most votes wins the seat. As a result, third-party votes are mostly “wasted” and for a long time created a strong incentive not to do them.
But after the 2010 general election, a confluence of global trends and specific circumstances — in particular, the Great Recession of 2008 and Prime Minister Tony Blair’s support for the Iraq War — led to a surge in votes for both the Liberal Democrats (an economically centrist, pro-European party that opposed the war) and a range of small regional parties. No party had a majority in Parliament.
Ideologically speaking, the best fit probably would have been a deal between the Labour Party and the Liberal Democrats, but there were two problems here.
First, the Conservatives won a lot more seats than Labour, so there was a strong sense that the former had “won the election” and should get to select the prime minister. Second, even in combination, Labour and the Liberal Democrats were a few seats short of a majority, which meant they would have had to rely on secondary alliances with the regional parties to form a majority.
So instead, the Liberal Democrats opted to work with David Cameron’s Conservative Party and form a coalition cabinet. This is highly unusual in UK politics. But they opted for this course rather than letting Cameron form a minority government, supposedly due to the need for stability in a time of economic crisis.
To further that goal of stability, the coalition government then passed the Fixed-Term Parliaments Act of 2011 , which denied the prime minister the authority to unilaterally call a new election. Under the new system, a Parliament would last a full five-year term unless a two-thirds supermajority voted for dissolution and early elections.
This law served its specific purpose and ensured that the coalition lasted its whole five-year term. But it’s now carried forward into a totally different situation and produced an unprecedented ability for the executive and legislative branches to systematically disagree.
The current impasse began with Conservative Prime Minister Theresa May’s efforts to get Parliament to approve the Brexit agreement she’d negotiated with the European Union at the beginning of the year.
Unfortunately, while no one in Parliament could seem to agree on what kind of deal they wanted, they all — including members of her own party — agreed that they didn’t like the deal May had on offer.
The Conservative Party contains a large faction that either actively favors a total rupturing of UK-EU ties (“hard Brexit”) or at least believes that a willingness to accept a chaotic “no deal” scenario will improve the UK’s bargaining hand and create a more satisfactory deal.
That meant that compromise measures designed to guarantee that there wouldn’t need to be a traditional border between Northern Ireland (which as part of the UK would be leaving the EU) and the Republic of Ireland (which is still in the EU) couldn’t pass Parliament with purely Conservative votes.
But rather than prop up May’s compromise efforts, opposition Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn took the position that the real problem was May and her negotiating position. He wanted a fresh election that he hoped to win, thus enabling him to pursue his own approach to Brexit (what exactly that approach would be has been a matter of some dispute ).
Key to this strategy was the belief that Labour was likely to do well in a new election, primarily because of the rise of a new Brexit Party that espoused a harder line than May. Labour believed that vote-splitting between the Conservatives and the Brexit Party could bring them to power, either alone or in partnership with some of the other parties.
With both Conservatives and members of the opposition blocking her every move, May faced a complete deadlock that eventually led to her resignation.
Enter Boris Johnson.
Johnson has promised to pull the UK out of the EU by the October 31 deadline, “do or die” — meaning with or without a deal with the EU in place. He also argues that the threat of a disruptive “no deal” Brexit will intimidate the EU into offering the UK better terms. Johnson is almost certainly wrong about this, and people familiar with Brussels say he’s fundamentally misunderstanding how the European Union works .
A critical faction of rebel Conservative MPs disagree with this strategy and sided with the opposition to block his plans. So now Johnson wants new elections — elections that he believes he will win because, having co-opted the hardline position on Brexit, he will secure a unified vote of Brexit supporters, while the skeptics will be divided across several parties.
Under the “classic” UK political system, this is exactly what would happen. Johnson would call a new election, and either the rogue Conservative MPs would be replaced by more reliable members, thus enabling Johnson to carry out his agenda unimpeded, or he’d lose big time and someone else would become prime minister and get to try their hand at managing Brexit.
But under the fixed-term system, this doesn’t work: A new election can be called only if the governing party and the opposition both agree to do one. And for that to happen, basically one party or the other has to miscalculate about who is going to win.
Right now, though, Johnson and Corbyn both agree that a fast election would likely help Johnson, so it seems unlikely to happen. The result is a situation that’s become very familiar to Americans: a mix of gridlock and “constitutional hardball” in which party leaders seek to exploit various technicalities or little-used powers to gain advantage and the actual policy outcomes don’t represent any party leader’s stated preference.
Since the main purpose of the Fixed-Term Parliaments Act was to secure the stability of one particular coalition government, the law perhaps should have been written to automatically expire after five years. Had that happened, the underlying arguments shaping Brexit would be exactly the same, but the ongoing entrenched political crisis would have been impossible.",source_text/d2701a7e7d898782232b97013c4f085949a597ecebebfea32b7a0da5c8e9a1a9-perplexity_3_0.txt,"But after the 2010 general election, a confluence of global trends and specific circumstances — in particular, the Great Recession of 2008 and Prime Minister Tony Blair’s support for the Iraq War — led to a surge in votes for both the Liberal Democrats (an economically centrist, pro-European party that opposed the war) and a range of small regional parties.

In contrast to the benefits of sleep, frameworks exploring the impact of sleep loss are relatively lacking. Importantly, the effects of sleep deprivation (SD) do not simply reflect the absence of sleep and the benefits attributed to it; rather, they reflect the consequences of several additional factors, including extended wakefulness. With a focus on neuroimaging studies, we review the consequences of SD on attention and working memory, positive and negative emotion, and hippocampal learning. We explore how this evidence informs our mechanistic understanding of the known changes in cognition and emotion associated with SD, and the insights it provides regarding clinical conditions associated with sleep disruption.
Without sleep, our cognitive and emotional abilities become markedly disrupted. What are the neural changes underlying these abnormalities? What do these alterations tell us about the pervasive link between sleep disruption and numerous neurological and psychiatric disorders?
There are at least three motivating reasons to build an accurate account of how sleep deprivation (SD) affects the human brain. First, from a neurobiological perspective, it is important to characterize which networks in the human brain are vulnerable or resilient to the effects of insufficient sleep and to understand how such SD-induced changes (such as regional or network increases or decreases in activity or changes in functional connectivity) explain the maladaptive changes in behaviour that are associated with SD. Of importance, SD does not simply represent the absence of sleep and the functions attributed to it. Rather, the sleep-deprived state is a composite of numerous detrimental factors, including extended wakefulness, as well as the absence of sleep. It is therefore insufficient only to develop an understanding of the functional benefits of sleep and then to reverse-infer an understanding of the neural and behavioural changes that would be expected following a lack thereof. Second, it is necessary to determine how comorbid sleep disruption — present in all major neurological and psychiatric conditions, including schizophrenia, Alzheimer disease, anxiety disorders and addiction disorders 1 , 2 — contributes to or results from these disorders and may thus be a target for disease treatment and/or prevention. Third, from a societal standpoint, such scientific evidence informs debates regarding sleep recommendations for both public and professional health policies in light of the acknowledged sleep-loss epidemic that now pervades industrialized nations 3 .
This Review seeks to move closer to these goals. We provide a focused overview of the impact of SD on the human brain across five functional domains: attention; working memory; positive, reward-related affect; negative affect; and hippocampus-dependent memory. Drawing on neuroimaging studies, we explore the neural signatures underlying phenotypic changes in cognition and affect following experimental SD. Moreover, we present examples of how these findings afford mechanistic insights into clinical disorders associated with disturbed sleep. The Review is necessarily focused on acute (24–48-hour) SD unless otherwise specified, as most neuroimaging studies to date are restricted to these time frames. Nevertheless, the issue of acute versus chronic sleep loss is discussed in more detail in BOX 1 .
A well-characterized feature of both acute sleep deprivation (SD) and chronic partial sleep restriction is a dose-dependent effect on task performance, especially in the domain of attention. The greater the amount and/or the longer duration of SD, the worse the accumulating attention deficit 6 . Thus, attentional impairment may be strongly coupled with extended wakefulness and with sleep pressure. These objectively measured impairments in performance are distinct from increases in subjective ratings of sleepiness following SD, which depend on the form of SD applied; for example, sleepiness increases as acute SD continues but does not always increase as chronic sleep restriction continues 5 . Thus, the physiological response to sleep loss may depend to some degree on the form of SD.
Regardless, the brain processes that mediate these cumulative deficits remain largely uncharacterized. For example, is there a brain region or set of brain regions involved in, or associated with, the tracking of sleep pressure 131 , or are there processes that track sleep pressure locally in a use-dependent manner within individual neuronal ensembles 132 ? Sleep pressure-related molecules, such as adenosine, and the hypothalamic system governing the switch mechanism between sleep and wake 133 are logical candidates for the chemical signalling and network mediation of this prototypical dose-dependent attentional impairment with sleep loss. In humans, neuroimaging analysis has revealed that association cortices, especially in the frontoparietal attention network, are particularly sensitive to sleep pressure, whereas subcortical thalamic and basal ganglia brain regions seem to be more affected by circadian processes 19 .
A second behavioural feature of SD that is poorly defined at the whole-brain level is a phenotypic difference in vulnerability to SD-associated cognitive impairments 134 – 138 . Approximately one third of participants show minimal impairments in sustained attention under SD conditions, and this seems to be a reliable, stable trait. By contrast, one third of participants manifest a severely vulnerable phenotype, showing marked attentional impairments. Moreover, it seems that differential vulnerability to the effects of acute sleep loss on attention is, in part, heritable 137 . Adding further complexity, the extent of an individual’s cognitive impairment also depends on which cognitive domain is tested 130 . Thus, although performance impairments following SD within any given cognitive domain are highly reliable within the same individual, the degree of impairment is not necessarily reliable across cognitive domains within the same individual. The underlying brain correlates that differentiate these stable intra-individual and inter-individual differences are unclear, but the functional integrity of the frontoparietal attention network and genetic influences on sleep and circadian regulation are probably key factors 139 , 140 .
One cognitive ability that is especially susceptible to sleep loss is attention, which serves ongoing goal-directed behaviour 4 . Performance on attentional tasks deteriorates in a dose-dependent manner with the amount of accrued time awake, owing to increasing sleep pressure 5 – 7 . The prototypic impairments on such tasks are known as ‘lapses’ or ‘microsleeps’, which involve response failures that reflect errors of omission 4 – 6 . More specifically, attentional maintenance becomes highly variable and erratic (with attention being sustained, lost, reestablished, then lost again), resulting in unstable task performance 4 . Although the focus of this Review is sleep loss, it should be noted that daytime circadian alerting signals interact with SD, resulting in exponentially scaling attentional impairment with extended wakefulness (for reviews, see REFS 7 , 8 ). Nevertheless, the cumulative amount of extended time spent awake predicts lapses in attention with acute SD and with chronic partial sleep restriction (the latter occurring across many nights) 5 ( BOX 1 ). Why some individuals are more or less vulnerable to these attentional impairments following SD than others is less well understood.
An increasingly clear picture is emerging of how brain function related to attentional tasks is altered by acute SD. Reductions in functional MRI (fMRI) signal in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) and intraparietal sulcus while performing attentional tasks are a robust and reliable consequence of SD 9 – 16 ( FIG. 1 ). Indeed, sleep loss not only decreases task-related activity in these frontal and parietal regions but also diminishes activity in, and connectivity with, the extrastriate visual cortex during visuospatial attention tasks 9 – 11 . The behavioural consequences of these neural changes are reflected in deficiencies in attending to one specific stimulus while ignoring distractors 10 , 11 , 17 or deficits in top-down allocation of attentional resources, such as orienting to a location where a target is expected to appear 9 , 18 . Beyond attentional focus at any particular moment, sleep loss impairs the capacity to sustain attention over time 4 . Here again, reductions in activity in the DLPFC and intraparietal sulcus contribute to attentional performance failure 11 – 15 , 19 .
a | Brain regions and networks associated with attention and working memory (frontoparietal network (FPN); red), arousal (thalamus; green) and the default mode network (DMN; blue) are affected by sleep deprivation. The DMN is a collection of brain areas, including midline frontoparietal regions, that often disengage when an individual performs an externally driven, goal-directed task and then re-engage when an individual stops performing that task. Suppression of the DMN is necessary to mobilize appropriate on-task brain networks to achieve successful goal-directed behaviour 181 , unless that task requires access to internally stored relevant information such as autobiographical memories or previously learned predictive cues 18 , 182 , 183 . Brain regions across multiple brain networks, including the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC), intraparietal sulcus (IPS), thalamus, medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) and posterior cingulate cortex (PCC), are differentially altered by sleep loss. b | In the sleep-rested state, there is reciprocal inhibition between task-related FPN activity and DMN activity, supported by sustained ascending arousal input from the thalamus. This leads to consistent attentional and working-memory performance. In the sleep-deprived state, there is unstable reciprocal inhibition between task-related FPN activity and DMN activity, and erratic ascending arousal activity influencing thalamic activity. As a result, there is reduced task-related FPN activity and intermittent intrusions of DMN activity during task engagement. The behavioural consequence is variable and/or impaired attention and working-memory performance, worsening with lowered thalamic activity and improving with higher thalamic activity.
In addition, thalamic activity during sustained attention is altered with SD, suggesting that the thalamus could be an interacting node in this SD-affected network. However, the profile of activity change within the thalamus is not uniform. Some studies demonstrated greater activity under conditions of sleep loss 11 , 16 , 20 – 23 , whereas others have reported intermittent periods of diminished thalamic activity 10 , 12 . These discrepancies may be understood in the context of performance and of the cortical arousal that thalamic activity provides. When thalamic activity is elevated under conditions of sleep loss, attentional performance is frequently maintained but, when substantial reductions in thalamic activity are observed, lapses in attention are common 4 , 10 , 12 , 15 . The thalamus therefore represents a pivotal gating hub through which alterations in brainstem ascending arousal signals affect cortical attentional networks under SD conditions. Extant data therefore support a model in which the instability in ascending arousal-promoting input contributes both to the emergence of canonical attentional lapses during SD and the erratic, unpredictable expression of these lapses over time 4 , 24 ( FIG. 1 ). Notably, the observed reductions in thalamic activity are not present during attentional lapses in well-rested conditions 12 , suggesting that increased homeostatic sleep pressure may have a unique role in lapses following SD.
More recently, instability of the default mode network (DMN) has been implicated in attentional impairments with SD. Several reports describe an inability to fully disengage midline anterior and posterior cortical regions of the DMN during both selective and sustained attentional task performance under SD conditions 13 , 16 , 25 ( BOX 2 ; FIG. 1 ). Moreover, increased DMN activity during on-task performance for both sustained and selective attention tests was predictive of slower and less accurate performance by the participants 16 , 25 .
In addition to inducing differences in task-related brain activity, sleep deprivation (SD) also affects resting-state brain connectivity. Resting-state networks are typically derived from the connectivity profile of spontaneous fluctuations in functional MRI (fMRI) signal and are thought to reflect the brain’s intrinsic functional architecture that emerges without external task demands 141 , 142 . Across these networks, SD is associated with reduced connectivity within the default mode network (DMN), the dorsal attention network, and the auditory, visual and motor networks 143 – 145 . In fact, measures of abnormal change in whole-brain connectivity enable classification of an individual as either being rested or sleep deprived with more than 60% accuracy 144 .
Of the many different discrete resting-state networks, the DMN has demonstrated alterations under SD in two specific ways. First, connectivity between individual nodes of the DMN is decreased following one night of total SD 143 , especially between midline anterior and posterior nodes of the DMN 146 . Thus, SD degrades network integrity within the DMN, functionally uncoupling individual nodes. The second consequence of SD is the failure of the DMN to remain functionally distinct from other normally dissociable networks. Under normal rested conditions, the DMN is functionally decoupled from the brain’s attentional networks — when the latter is engaged, the former is disengaged, and vice versa 147 . Both total SD and partial sleep restriction 122 , 148 – 150 impair this adaptive decoupling, and this impairment is further associated with participants’ cognitive vulnerability to SD 143 .
The resting profiles of individual regions, specifically the amygdala and the thalamus, have also been examined following SD 151 , 152 . Similar to task-related connectivity changes (see FIG. 3 ), decreases in resting-state connectivity of the amygdala with regulatory and executive regions of the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and anterior cingulate cortex have been demonstrated after 36 hours of SD. Conversely, resting-state connectivity of the amygdala with the posterior cingulate cortex and the precuneus increases after SD, possibly reflecting the role of these posterior midline cortical regions in regulating the balance between internally and externally directed cognition 153 . Resting-state connectivity between the thalamus and cortical regions is also generally decreased following sleep loss, especially thalamic connectivity with anterior and posterior cingulate regions of the DMN 143 and with attentional and executive regions of the superior and medial prefrontal cortex 151 . As reductions in thalamocortical connectivity have also been demonstrated during sleep onset 154 , it remains possible that resting-state measures in sleep-deprived individuals capture mixed states of sleep and wake, comprising rapid transitions into sleep (known as microsleeps), while some degree of wake-like behavioural responding is nevertheless maintained 155 . This concern is emphasized by reports that have demonstrated reduced functional coupling between midline anterior and posterior nodes of the DMN under conditions of SD and once individuals have entered non-rapid eye movement sleep 156 . Overall, the limited evidence to date suggests that SD triggers reductions in the brain’s intrinsic connectivity profile, ultimately leading to a breakdown of network integrity and a loss of adaptive functional segregation. These alterations may precede or exacerbate changes in task-related responses observed after sleep loss, and might predict the magnitude of cognitive and emotional impairments elicited by SD. A combination of task-related and resting-state fMRI studies of SD seems to be a fruitful avenue for future work, although accurate assessment of sleep or wake states inside the MRI scanner is warranted to assure the absence of microsleeps.
a | Sleep deprivation (SD) amplifies amygdala reactivity (red) in response to negative emotional stimuli and decreases associated amygdala–medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) connectivity (blue). b | SD alters sensitivity of the salience-detection network (the amygdala, anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) and anterior insula (AI)) to varying levels of emotional stimuli that range in valence strength ( x axis in the two graphs) from negative (red) to neutral (blue) to positive (red). Under sleep-rested conditions (left graph), there is a wide and dynamic range of salience-detection sensitivity, resulting in the ability to accurately discriminate between degrees of emotional salience (tall vertical difference arrow; discerning emotional (red vertical line) from neutral stimuli (blue vertical line)). By contrast, SD (right graph) is proposed to trigger a narrowing and thus more nonspecific detection sensitivity range, impairing the ability to accurately discriminate between degrees of emotional salience (short vertical difference arrow). This loss of ‘net neutrality’ results in over-generalized emotional sensitivity, wherein an otherwise largely neutral stimulus (blue vertical line) is inappropriately registered as ‘emotional’ by the salience-detection network; further observed in biased emotional ratings of neutral stimuli. c | A downstream behavioural consequence of these central brain changes, in combination with disrupted peripheral autonomic nervous system feedback of visceral body information, could lead to inaccurate and even absent outward expression of emotions. This is supported by experimental evidence demonstrating that individuals deprived of sleep fail to register emotional faces shown to them on a screen and consequently are unable to accurately mimic the emotional face expressions of these target faces themselves.

Why the sleep-deprived brain suffers this unstable ‘flip-flop’ gating between on-task functional activity and off-task DMN activity remains unclear. One candidate is abnormal activity of the right frontoinsular cortex, which controls the switch between DMN activity and task-related activity 26 . Consistent with this thesis, the salience-detection network, which includes the frontoinsular cortex, demonstrates reduced activity during the performance of attention tasks following sleep loss 27 . Together with changes in the frontoparietal attention network described above, these insula-based alterations may explain SD-induced impairments in attention to novel, salient targets 28 and in the tracking of salient moving targets 29 . Nevertheless, trial-by-trial analyses of fMRI signal during salience-detection and attention tasks will be required to test this hypothesis.
Working memory — the neural basis of which overlaps anatomically with the attention system — is also impaired by SD 30 , 31 . Deficits in both working- memory and attention tasks have been found to correlate with reductions in DLPFC and posterior parietal activity 20 – 22 , 32 , 33 . As during attention tasks, fluctuations in thalamic activity 20 – 22 and inappropriate perseverance of DMN activity are observed during working-memory task performance under SD conditions 20 , 21 , 32 . In addition, the degree of aberrant, on-task DMN activity predicts the severity of working-memory impairment in sleep-deprived individuals 20 , 21 , 32 ( FIG. 1 ). Inappropriate gating of on-task relative to off-task network control may therefore provide one common mechanism underlying deficits in both attention and working memory caused by SD.
Also mirroring changes observed during attention tasks, alterations in thalamic activity and connectivity predict impairments in working-memory performance under SD conditions, most likely owing to the key role of the thalamus in cortical arousal. For example, increased connectivity between the hippocampus, the thalamus and the DMN predicts higher subjective sleepiness and is associated with worse working-memory performance under sleep-loss conditions 34 , 35 . By contrast, increased connectivity between the thalamus and the precuneus under SD conditions predicts greater recovery of working-memory performance, relative to the sleep-rested state. This finding is consistent with the hypothesis that, in the context of SD, the brain exhibits compensatory neural activity that can enable partial recovery of the performance of certain behaviours 34 , 36 .
Beyond reductions in activity in frontoparietal areas, extrastriate (visual) cortical regions also demonstrate reduced signal during visual working-memory task performance under conditions of sleep loss 21 , 22 , 32 . Recent evidence suggests a causal contribution of this regional decrease in task-related activation to performance deficits, as transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) targeted to the extrastriate cortex of sleep-deprived individuals improved visual working-memory performance, restoring it back to baseline levels 37 , 38 . Remarkably, repeated TMS application every 6 hours for 18 hours to extrastriate regions maintained working-memory performance for up to 3 days without sleep 38 . However, TMS stimulation intervention in the context of SD is not always consistent, and thus the reproducibility of such effects remains unclear 39 . Should a robust method for intervention emerge, it may have real-world relevance — for example, for professions in which attentive focus is crucial and SD is common (aviation or the military).
The mesolimbic reward system is a network of interconnected brain regions, including the midbrain ventral tegmental area, striatum and regions of the PFC. The ventral tegmental area provides dopaminergic innervation to the striatum, which is connected to, and regulated by, areas of the PFC, particularly by the medial PFC (mPFC) and inferior orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) regions, guiding motivated actions and learning. This system has repeatedly been demonstrated to show sensitivity to SD, leading to alterations in motivated behaviours, such as risk taking, sensation seeking and impulsivity ( FIG. 2 ).
a | Reward-relevant brain regions that are affected by sleep deprivation (SD) include cortical regions (blue) such as the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC), insula and orbitofrontal cortex (OFC), and the subcortical region of the striatum (red). b | Increased adenosine load (blue circles) associated with SD triggers downregulation of dopamine (DA) D2 and D3 receptors (D2/3Rs), resulting in decreased receptor membrane expression within the striatum (internalized receptors; grey). Consequently, there is a greater ratio of D1R to D2/3R availability, and the relative increase in striatal D1R activation by DA (green circles) under SD conditions is proposed to increase risk-related and reward-related approach behaviours, shown in the see-saw imbalance. c | SD further disrupts incentive processing within PFC regions and thus is proposed to result in a lower signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) under SD conditions (represented by a narrow dynamic range of PFC sensitivity). This consequentially impairs the ability to accurately map and update changing value or reward probability (coloured dots) over time — such as that involved in reinforcement learning, ultimately contributing to non-optimal incentive-based decision making.
In rats, SD disrupts dopaminergic function by modifying dopamine receptor sensitivity and availability in basal ganglia regions 40 , 41 . Humans deprived of sleep for one night show increases in ventral striatum activity in mixed monetary gamble task during the anticipation and receipt of monetary rewards 42 , 43 . Activity in affect-related regions in the frontal cortex that are associated with valuation and viscerosensory functions, including the insula and mPFC, is also substantially increased following SD 42 , 43 .
Together, these findings suggest that subcortical reward-related regions of the brain, together with related cortical regions coding salience and valuation, seem to become hypersensitized by the state of acute SD. However, the degree to which fMRI signal amplitude tracks reward magnitude in these subcortical and cortical regions does not seem to differ between rested and deprived conditions 44 . Rather, SD triggers a generalized increase in reward sensitivity that impairs reward discrimination accuracy, such that the brain becomes less capable of accurately coding incremental increases in reward value, from low to high.
Consistent with this thesis, fMRI signal in the mPFC, OFC and anterior insula cortex in sleep-deprived individuals does not accurately discriminate between trials involving monetary reward and punishment values and trials involving no monetary reward or punishment 42 , 43 . This inaccurate representation of reward value within frontal regions is similarly observed during the outcome phase of incentive decision trials 42 , 43 , suggesting a further failure to update accruing reward history and probability. Inaccurate coding of reward and/or punishment valence in the PFC following sleep loss may therefore prevent the ability to update changing incentive value (weights) of reinforcing stimuli over time 42 , 43 ( FIG. 2 ). This would further contribute to non-optimal reward-dependent decision making and actions. Fitting this profile, sleep-deprived individuals performing the Iowa Gambling Task make more-risky decisions and assign greater weights to more-recent rewards 45 , 46 . This pattern indicates a failure to appropriately integrate rewards and their accumulating value over time following SD, reflecting temporally shorter -sighted updating of rewards.
In addition to deficits in the activation of frontal reward circuits following SD, studies have revealed that responses of the striatum and amygdala to emotionally pleasurable or hedonic images 47 , as well as desirable food stimuli 48 , are amplified with SD. Moreover, the same studies reported failures of discriminatory signalling of stimulus valence (for example, discriminating desirable from undesirable foods) in the anterior insula, mPFC and OFC, of sleep-deprived participants. Furthermore, sleep- deprived individuals were more likely to rate neutral pictures as positive 47 or to express a greater desire for high-calorie foods 48 . That is, participants fail to accurately disambiguate non-rewarding from rewarding stimuli when sleep deprived, shifting towards an over-generalized reward bias, even for normally less-rewarding stimuli.
Although current results of reward processing point to effects in the mPFC, OFC and insular cortex, together with the basal ganglia, other affective regions, such as the limbic regions of the medial temporal lobe and executive lateral regions of the PFC, should not be discounted. Equally important, not all human SD studies have reported amplified basal ganglia activity during reward-related decision making 49 , an inconsistency we return to below.
Beyond monetary reward processing, another behavioural feature sensitive to a lack of sleep is impulsivity. Impulsivity is a multifactorial construct, and different types of impulsivity can manifest in behaviourally different ways. Nevertheless, impulse control is central to many incentive-based decision processes 50 , 51 . Changes in impulsivity may therefore contribute to alterations in reward decision making and risk taking that occur following SD.
In tasks that require either cued motor response execution or withholding, often referred to as a Go/No-Go task, participants with either partial sleep restriction (6 hours of sleep per night for 4 consecutive nights) or one night of total sleep deprivation showed considerably lower response inhibition and cognitive control, produced more frequent errors of inhibition, and exhibited slower learning of cue–incentive associations 52 – 56 ( FIG. 2 ).
However, in delay-discounting tasks, which require participants to choose between small, immediate rewards relative to large, delayed rewards, SD does not seem to alter impulsivity — a lack of an effect that is similarly observed in probabilistic discounting tasks, in which participants choose between small but certain rewards and large but uncertain rewards 49 , 53 , 54 , 57 . Similarly, total acute SD and partial sleep restriction (4 nights of 6 hours of sleep per night) do not affect delay discounting or probabilistic discounting 54 . However, measures of effort discounting (whereby rewards are discounted according to the effort required to attain them) are affected by SD. Under conditions of sleep loss, low-effort rewards elicit even greater reward-related brain activity than high-effort rewards, relative to sleep-rested conditions 49 .
Similarly, inconsistent effects of SD have been reported using the Balloon Analogue Risk Task (BART) — a standard test of reward-seeking, risk-taking behaviour that involves impulse control. Partial sleep restriction (1 night of 5 hours of sleep) results in a significant increase in the tendency to overinflate a computerized balloon to obtain more reward 54 , 58 . By contrast, total SD for a single night resulted in no change in BART performance by male participants but a decrease in risky overinflation by female participants 53 (for a review, see REF. 59 ). Studies that focus on this and other specific features of impulsivity, such as response withholding, while systematically keeping other factors constant (for example, reward magnitude, reward delay and sex) are necessary to develop a clearer understanding of sleep loss and risk-taking impulsivity.
Inconsistencies in the effects of SD on incentive processing are not limited to the domain of impulsivity. Some reports using incentive tasks that do not involve impulsivity (wherein participants simply expect or receive rewards and/or punishments without needing to resist impulsive responses) have also failed to show significant differences in mesolimbic brain activity and/ or behaviour caused by SD 44 , 49 , 57 . Instead, these studies only demonstrate effects on an individual-participant level 44 , 49 , 57 . One possible explanation is that some studies employ mixed gambles, combining gains and losses in the same trial. This may limit the ability to identify differences in processing of gains or losses independently 60 . A second possibility is that individual differences may interact with the effects of SD, thus obscuring group-level significance if not explicitly considered. A recent study 60 found that individuals expressing a variant of the dopamine transporter that was previously associated with differences in synaptic dopamine availability showed different striatal reward responses following sleep loss. Unlike the control group, only participants with trait-elevated synaptic dopamine exhibited greater striatal responses during reward anticipation following SD than when well rested. This suggests that phasic dopamine availability is increased in these individuals, thereby elevating SD-associated increases in the reward responsivity of the nucleus accumbens. Thus, effects of sleep loss on reward processing seem to be sensitive to several interacting factors, including sex and trait genetics.
With these nuances taken into account, studies to date nevertheless indicate that SD significantly increases the tendency of reward sensitivity, risk taking and impulsivity, and disrupts reward-value updating and integration. One possible mechanism that might explain these increases in approach and consummatory behaviour is altered dopamine signalling, which is associated with extended wakefulness perhaps more than with the absence of sleep itself. Several lines of evidence support this dopaminergic framework ( FIG. 2 ).
First, dopamine is associated with arousal; innately higher levels of dopamine predict lower sleep propensity 61 . Second, rodent studies have established that wake-promoting stimulant drugs such as amphetamine seem to operate in part by blocking dopamine metabolism, thereby increasing dopamine transmission and thus arousal. Third, depleting catecholamines, including dopamine, reduces wake propensity, lowering vigilance and inducing sleep 62 (although interestingly the antihypertensive and antipsychotic reserpine, which reduces catecholamine function, has nominal effects on sleepiness 63 ).
Changes in dopamine receptors may also contribute to alterations in reward-driven behaviour following SD. Positron emission tomography (PET) ligand studies have reported that one night of total SD downregulates the availability of dopamine D2 and D3 receptors (D2/3Rs) in both the dorsal striatum (which includes the caudate and putamen) and ventral striatum 40 ( FIG. 2 ), consistent with earlier PET studies showing general hypometabolism in the basal ganglia following SD 64 . PET-assessed downregulation of D2/3Rs in the ventral striatum predicted fMRI-measured decreases in thalamic activity during an attentional task 65 , as did the degree of generalized hypometabolism in the basal ganglia after SD 64 , 66 . Besides the relevance of this change for objective attention and working -memory performance, the degree of D2/3R downregulation similarly predicts subjective sleepiness under SD conditions 40 . This result suggests that sleep pressure might be indexed by the levels of different dopamine receptors; consistent with this, adenosine accumulates with increasing time awake, activating A 2A receptors and thereby driving D2R internalization 40 , 67 . Moreover, agonists of the A 2A receptor and D2R demonstrate allosteric interaction such that A 2A receptor agonists decrease the affinity of D2Rs for their agonists, including dopamine 68 . Thus, adenosine accumulation, which is associated with increased time spent awake, may decrease D2/3R activity by at least two possible mechanisms: by increasing D2/3R internalization and by reducing binding of dopamine to D2Rs ( FIG. 2 ).
That SD is associated with a downregulation of D2/3Rs may initially seem to contradict the SD-associated increases in neural and behavioural reward sensitivity described above. However, one tenable (and experimentally testable) hypothesis that may reconcile this paradox involves D1Rs. Specifically, decreases in D2/3Rs could result in an imbalance of dopamine receptor availability, leading to the remaining D1Rs becoming disproportionately stimulated by the same amount of presynaptically released dopamine ( FIG. 2 ). Outside the context of SD, in rodents, this imbalance causes greater approach behaviour to food rewards 69 and increases the addictive potential of cocaine 70 (behavioural consequences that, notably, have both been independently associated with SD 71 , 72 ). Furthermore, the increase in striatal fMRI signal elicited by reward incentives under SD conditions seems to principally reflect D1R action 73 . Thus, SD-associated decreases in D2/3R availability may, by indirectly increasing dopamine binding to the remaining D1Rs, increase approach-driven and reward-driven behaviour and fMRI-indexed striatal activity ( FIG. 2 ). The neural and behavioural consequences of sleep loss on incentive processes also offer mechanistic and therapeutic insights into the conditions of obesity, addiction and substance use ( BOX 3 ).
Positive emotion
The interaction between sleep deprivation (SD) and dopaminergic reward functioning is relevant for clinical conditions involving sleep disruption and dysfunction of reward or dopamine signalling. In alcohol addiction, ~60% of alcohol-addicted individuals seeking treatment complain of insomnia symptoms in the 6 months leading up to intervention, and more than half of these individuals report using alcohol under the (erroneous) assumption that it helps to regulate sleep 157 . In addition, alcohol-addicted individuals who report insomnia are more likely to relapse than those without sleep problems 157 . Thus, sleep loss seems to be an important factor in the development and/or maintenance of addiction disorders associated with changes in mesolimbic dopamine function and a vulnerability factor predisposing individuals to fail in efforts of abstinence. Of concern, sleep disruption in childhood predicts subsequent substance use in later adolescence stages 158 .
There is now also considerable epidemiological evidence linking sleep disruption and obesity 159 . Experimental work has characterized the associated causal mechanisms, including changes in the appetite-regulating hormones leptin and ghrelin, and in the central brain mechanisms that regulate appetite and food choice selection 160 . Decreased activity in decision-regulating regions of the frontal cortex following SD, combined with enhanced subcortical mesolimbic sensitivity, leads to increased desire for, and selection of, high-calorie food items 48 . Indeed, compared with a sleep-rested state, experimental sleep restriction increases calorie consumption and promotes weight gain 161 .
Notably, the alterations in brain function that have been associated with obesity overlap with those observed in drug addiction 162 ; for example, a reduction of dopamine D2 and D3 receptors is observed in both. Such findings warrant a deeper consideration of insufficient sleep as a possible predisposing factor underlying obesity and drug addiction. If true, targeted sleep restoration may aid by re-engaging neural mechanisms that govern adaptive food choices and craving, respectively.
Negative emotion
A recent model has proposed that sleep loss prevents the normal overnight lowering and thus restoration of central adrenergic signalling that normally occurs during rapid eye movement (REM) sleep, leading to heightened noradrenergic tone and thereby an over-generalized responsivity within select affective salience networks 84 . The translational ramifications of this model are well exemplified in post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), which is associated with sleep disruption and fragmentation, decreases in total and REM sleep duration 163 – 165 , and nocturnal hyperarousal 166 – 168 . In parallel, people with PTSD show marked alterations in noradrenergic activity 163 , including the lack of normal overnight reduction in noradrenaline levels 169 . The REM-sleep model may help to understand these co-occurring features. Specifically, decreases in night-time, total and REM sleep quantity, and increases in high-frequency electroencephalogram (EEG)-assessed activity (associated with hyperarousal) during REM sleep, are proposed to contribute to daytime hyperadrenergic tone in PTSD. Moreover, persistent hyperadrenergic activity during wakefulness could reduce subsequent night-time sleep quantity and quality, producing a vicious cycle. Crucially, this cycle could lead to over-generalized emotional sensitivity within the affective salience network of the brain that is innervated by noradrenaline, including the amygdala, and the viscerosensory regions of the insula and anterior cingulate cortex, as already reported in a meta-analysis of functional MRI studies in PTSD 89 . This same model could explain how nocturnal use of prazosin — an α1-adrenergic receptor antagonist commonly prescribed for PTSD — can, in some cohorts, restore the duration and quality of total and REM sleep, and decrease PTSD symptoms 170 – 173 . Our framework may also account for the excessive emotion reactivity and impaired emotional discrimination observed in PTSD 174 – 176 , and the maladaptive generalization of fear responses to commonly non-threatening stimuli 174 – 176 . Interestingly, PTSD-like symptomatology was experimentally induced by selective deprivation of REM sleep in healthy individuals; this manipulation resulted in increased autonomic sensitivity to previously extinguished conditioned stimuli (that is, heightened sensitivity) and impaired autonomic discrimination of conditioned from safety signals (decreased emotional specificity) 177 – 179 . Conversely, the amount and EEG quality of REM sleep predicts participants’ ability to accurately discriminate between threat and safety signals (indicating improved emotional specificity) 180 .
Sleep loss reliably triggers changes in negative (aversive) emotional processing, including irritability, emotional volatility, anxiety and aggression 56 , 74 – 77 , as well as suicidal ideation, suicide attempts and suicide completion 78 – 80 . These findings suggest that SD alters specific process domains, including basic affective reactivity, as well as emotional discrimination and emotional expression, which are more complex.
Early neuroimaging studies focused on the effects of SD on responsivity to rudimentary aversive stimuli; for example, one night of SD was shown to result in a 60% increase in amygdala reactivity to negative images, such as weapons, venomous snakes and spiders, and mutilations 81 ( FIG. 3 ). This signature of amygdala hyper-reactivity has since been replicated following sleep restriction (4 hours of sleep per night for 5 nights) 82 and in individuals with poor sleep quality, as assessed at their homes 83 . Notably, amygdala hyper-reactivity has been reported during rapid, subconscious viewing of faces expressing fear after sleep restriction 82 , indicating that this amplified limbic reactivity can occur subliminally, independent of conscious, deliberative cognition 82 .
One possible mechanism underlying such amygdala hypersensitivity involves a loss of regulatory control, resulting in contextually inappropriate amygdala reactivity 84 . Decreases in functional connectivity between top-down control regions of the mPFC and the amygdala have been reported following a night of total SD or 5 nights of partial sleep restriction (4 hours sleep per night), as well as in participants reporting less than 6 hours of habitual sleep 81 – 83 , 85 , 86 ( FIG. 3 ).
SD further alters the brain anticipation of cued emotional experiences. For example, one night of SD elevates cue-evoked activity in the amygdala, anterior insula and anterior cingulate cortex in anticipation of impending emotional picture slides, similar to those described above 87 , and also increases anticipatory responses of the peripheral autonomic nervous system 88 .
Interestingly, inter-individual differences in trait anxiety levels predict the size of these SD-induced increases in anticipatory brain activity, with highly trait-anxious individuals expressing the largest increases in pre-emptive anterior insula activity 87 . The latter result is of clinical relevance to anxiety disorders (which have been associated with apprehensive worry about future events) for at least three reasons: first, highly trait-anxious individuals are already those at greatest risk for developing an anxiety disorder; second, excessive anticipatory insula activity is a characteristic of most anxiety disorders 89 – 91 ; and third, sleep disruption is a recognized symptom of anxiety disorders 92 .
An additional phenotype of the sleep-deprived human brain emerges when participants are challenged with the more complex task of disambiguating between varied emotional signals. In sleep-rested participants, regions of the amygdala, insula and cingulate that are associated with salience detection can discriminate between stimuli of different emotional strengths. By contrast, in sleep-deprived participants, these regions demonstrate a saturated and flattened response to emotional stimuli. Sleep-deprived individuals therefore express a generalized excess of emotional sensitivity, with impairment in emotional discriminatory specificity 84 ( FIG. 3 ). For example, sleep-deprived individuals are less accurate at rating facial expressions within the moderate range of emotional strength 93 and rate neutral images as more emotionally negative 94 . SD further impairs the accurate discrimination of threatening (antisocial) from affiliative (pro-social) facial signals 95 , again promoting an overall bias towards increased (inaccurate) perception of negative threat.
Recent work has begun to uncover the neural basis of these impairments in emotional discrimination ( FIG. 3 ). Consistent with the failure to accurately code positive, reward incentive signals (described above), one night of SD impairs the discrimination of faces expressing negative emotions by viscerosensory regions of the anterior insula and anterior cingulate cortices, and to a degree, the subcortical amygdala 95 . Similarly, sleep loss results in generalized, nonspecific increases in amygdala activity (as measured by fMRI or electroencephalography) in response to aversive and neutral emotional pictures 96 , 97 .
These findings have led to the proposal that SD causes a state of central and peripheral emotional hypersensitivity that prevents emotional reactivity from being appropriately graded 84 . As a result, SD impairs the afferent–efferent communication between the brain and body, which is crucial for the ‘embodied’ mapping of, and disambiguation between, different emotions. The consequence is a behavioural phenotype of indiscriminate emotional generalization, or blunting, consistent with poor signal-to-noise balance during emotional processing 84 ( FIG. 3 ).
Such blunting may disrupt not only the internal mapping of an individual’s own affective state but also the ability to simulate the feelings of others. Supporting this hypothesis, sleep-deprived individuals and habitually poor sleepers demonstrate impaired empathetic sensitivity, which involved sensing the emotion state of individuals in picture slides 98 , 99 . Sensing the internal homeostatic status of the body, and thereby tracking one’s own affective state, requires interoceptive processing within a network that includes the insula, mPFC and amygdala 100 . Sleep loss degrades the sensitivity of this network, leading to a shift of the homeostatic set point used to register, and differentiate between different levels of, emotional salience 95 . In an emotional face discrimination task, sleep-deprived individuals showed overgeneralized activity in viscerosensory brain regions and impaired autonomic cardiac discrimination (indexed using moment-by-moment changes in heart rate) 95 . Compared with when they were rested, individuals who were sleep deprived also showed a weaker correlation between the activity of the central and peripheral autonomic (cardiac) systems. Thus, SD compromises the faithful discrimination of emotional signals within higher-order emotional brain regions by inducing network hypersensitivity and, in tandem, disrupts the ‘embodied’ reciprocity between viscerosensory central and peripheral autonomic processing of complex social signals. As a result, there can be a loss of sensitivity in detecting, and accuracy in recognizing, emotions.
It is possible, although currently untested, that this same disruption within and between central and peripheral autonomic nervous system networks explains why sleep-deprived adults 101 and infants deprived of a day-time nap 102 show incongruent or even absent outward expression of emotions ( FIG. 3 ). Individuals restricted to 4 hours of sleep for a single night also demonstrate a slowing of reactive facial expressions in response to emotional stimuli 103 . Emotional vocalizations following short-term sleep restriction have similarly been reported to be blunted 104 .
Thus, multiple modes of emotional expression are diminished by insufficient sleep; a feature pertinent considering that emotional expressions are all influenced in some manner by the autonomic nervous system, specifically the vagal system 105 . This same explanatory model of central–peripheral autonomic decoupling may offer further mechanistic insights into the recognized associations between reduced sleep and decreased interpersonal functioning 108 , increased antisocial interactions 109 , a lower understanding of relationship concerns (leading to greater interpersonal conflict) 110 and, in children and adolescents, increased peer-related problems, such as hyperactivity and inattention, conduct problems, and peer disagreement 106 , 107 .
Less understood are the cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying the emotional brain and body dysfunction that is caused by a lack of sleep. One proposed mechanism has centred on the heightened noradrenergic tone from the locus coeruleus 84 , 111 , 112 ; according to this hypothesis, sleep loss prevents the normal overnight reduction in noradrenergic tone that usually occurs during rapid eye movement (REM) sleep 112 – 114 . The resulting hypernoradrenergic tone may thus lead to heightened and over-generalized responsivity within the affective salience network that is innervated by noradrenaline: the amygdala and the viscerosensory cortical regions 84 . Consequently, there may be a loss of specificity in affective signalling within this network, possibly helping to explain the SD-associated inaccuracy in emotional discrimination. This REM sleep model 84 offers several testable predictions regarding the reliable co-occurrence of sleep disruption (including REM sleep disruption) in clinical anxiety disorders ( BOX 3 ). However, noradrenaline alone is unlikely to be the sole neurochemical factor underlying the affective dysregulation caused by SD. Integrating changes in other sleep-dependent neurochemicals, such as dopamine, may provide a more accurate explanatory model.
Many studies have characterized the beneficial impact of sleep on the post-learning, offline consolidation of hippocampus-dependent memories (for a review, see REF. 115 ). By contrast, few studies have explored the adverse effects of SD on this process 115 ; instead, the majority of such neuroimaging investigations have examined the impact of sleep loss on initial hippocampus-dependent memory encoding, on which we focus here.
In rodents, SD substantially decreases the ability to induce hippocampal long-term potentiation (LTP; an electrophysiological measure of neuroplasticity) and, if LTP is induced, the enhancement subsequently decays more rapidly 116 . Further, sleep loss reduces hippocampal synthesis of proteins associated with neuroplasticity and impairs hippocampal neurogenesis 117 .
The extracellular build-up of the metabolic product adenosine during extended wake affects plasticity. High levels of adenosine disrupt intracellular cAMP signalling in rodents and decreases hippocampal AMPA and NMDA receptor signalling; all of which are necessary for stable LTP 115 . Given that adenosine is cleared from the brain during sleep, these effects on plasticity may result from two mutually non-exclusive reasons: abnormally extended wake or a loss of sleep.
Building on these findings, early human neuroimaging and behavioural studies established that one night of SD impairs learning and encoding-related activity within the medial temporal lobe 118 , specifically the hippocampus 36 ( FIG. 4 ). Moreover, selective deprivation of non-rapid eye movement (NREM) slow-wave sleep using auditory stimulation, which preserves total sleep time, also lowers encoding-related activity in the hippocampus and associated learning 119 . Conversely, enhancing the power of NREM slow-wave activity, using transcranial stimulation, increases hippocampal learning ability after sleep 120 , further supporting a causal role for slow-wave sleep in hippocampal memory encoding.
Sleep deprivation (SD) decreases encoding-related activity within the hippocampus (light blue), compared with normal sleep-rested conditions. Moreover, in sleep-deprived individuals, hippocampal connectivity with encoding-relevant cortical regions of the intraparietal sulcus (IPS), posterior cingulate cortex (PCC) and primary visual cortex (V1) (purple regions) during encoding is lower than in sleep-rested individuals. By contrast, hippocampal encoding-related connectivity with subcortical arousal regions of the thalamus and brainstem (red) after SD is increased.
In addition, SD alters learning-related hippocampal connectivity. Functional coupling between the hippocampus and perceptual regions of the occipital (visual) cortex and nearby regions in the medial temporal lobe during visual episodic-memory encoding is decreased under SD conditions 36 ( FIG. 4 ). By contrast, SD is also associated with increases in hippocampal connectivity with subcortical arousal regions, including the brainstem and the thalamus 36 ( FIG. 4 ). The latter observation has been interpreted as reflecting a compensatory effort to mobilize basic arousal networks, albeit insufficient to rescue behavioural performance 36 .
A recent report has demonstrated that the structural morphology of the human hippocampus, and specifically the volume of the CA3–dentate gyrus subfield region, predicts the degree of vulnerability to the impact of SD on memory encoding 121 . Moreover, this same measure also predicted the amplitude of NREM slow-wave oscillations during recovery sleep and, by way of this mediating influence, determined how well memory-encoding ability was restored when assessed again after recovery sleep. Thus, human hippocampal subfield anatomy may represent a novel trait-like factor and potential biomarker of susceptibility of memory processing to, and recovery from, the disrupting effects of SD.
The hippocampus does not operate in isolation during memory encoding, however, but acts in a broad network of anatomically and functionally connected cortical regions. Some of these are proposed to participate in encoding memory representations themselves (for example, sensory perceptual regions), whereas others are involved in operations that support the act of encoding, such as the DLPFC and posterior parietal regions, which are required for directed attention 32 . Consistent with this, human neuroimaging studies have revealed that SD is associated with larger-network impairments that co-occur or are functionally linked with deficits in hippocampus-dependent encoding of new memories. For example, SD for 24 hours decreases activity in regions of the DLPFC and posterior parietal cortex required for goal-directed attention during a visual episodic- memory encoding task 122 . Reductions in the activity of the scene-selective fusiform cortex following SD are less clear to interpret and may reflect impairment in the functional role of the visual cortex in processing visual scenes and/or the failure of the top-down control of attention by frontoparietal networks 123 . Nevertheless, the size of the alterations in activity of all three of these cortical regions (frontal, parietal and occipital) predict the degree of memory impairment under SD conditions and the severity of attentional task lapses.
As with working-memory and selective attention tasks, significant differences in DMN activity within cortical regions have been reported during episodic-memory encoding following SD 124 . Indeed, the size of reductions and increases in the activity of the anterior cingulate and precuneus (which are both nodes of the DMN), respectively, discriminated sleep-deprived from sleep-rested participants with 93% sensitivity and 92% specificity 124 . Unstable control of the DMN might therefore be a common neural phenotype underlying deficits in various cognitive tasks (including attention, working memory and episodic memory) in the sleep-deprived human brain ( BOX 2 ).
Only one study to date has examined the under lying neurochemical basis of memory-encoding deficits associated with SD. Administration of an acetylcholinesterase inhibitor, which prolongs the central synaptic effects of acetylcholine, partially restored activity in frontoparietal and fusiform regions in sleep-deprived participants towards levels observed under sleep-rested conditions 122 ( FIG. 4 ). Interestingly, the greatest benefit of this acetylcholinesterase inhibitor treatment was observed in those individuals who, with SD, demonstrated the largest decreases in brain activity during a semantic judgement task and the worst performance in word recognition. That is, those most susceptible to sleep loss on these tasks were those who recovered most function after being treated with the drug.
Given that acetylcholinesterase inhibitors enhance attentional processes that support episodic memory 125 and directly affect sensory processing 126 , some part of this benefit might be mediated by cholinergic influences on arousal. An alternative or additional plausible hypothesis is that the actions of the inhibitor facilitate hippocampal plasticity mechanisms that consequentially increase hippocampal engagement of sensory and attentional networks in the cortex. Accordingly, acetylcholinesterase inhibitors enhance activation of the visual and parietal cortices in sleep-deprived individuals during a visual short-term-memory task and, compared with placebo, improve task performance 127 .
At a translational level, impaired hippocampus-dependent memory encoding following sleep loss is relevant to several disorders and conditions that involve deficiencies in both sleep and memory encoding. Two such examples are ageing and dementia. Older, cognitively normal adults show marked impairments in NREM sleep, and these deficits are magnified in size in Alzheimer disease 128 . Disruptions of NREM sleep and associated reductions in slow-wave activity and sleep spindles in older adults and, even more dramatically, in patients with Alzheimer disease predict reductions in encoding-related activity in the hippocampus on the following day, which, in turn, predict the degree of learning impairment 119 , 129 . Sleep disruption therefore may contribute to cognitive decline, and especially impairments in hippocampus-dependent memory processing, with ageing. This evidence raises the possibility that sleep restoration may be a novel therapeutic intervention, as well as a midlife preventative measure against age-related decline in hippocampus-dependent memory (for a more detailed discussion, see REF. 128 ).
Several insights emerge from this Review. First, SD triggers a complex set of bidirectional changes in brain activity and connectivity — depending on the specific functional operation and anatomical regions in question. Equally important, however, are moment-to-moment fluctuations in brain activity that occur during performance across the timescale of minutes, reflecting a neural phenotype of regional and network instability. This is especially apparent in the domains of attention and working memory. Second, the heterogeneous array of brain changes (averaged and moment-to-moment) results in an equally diverse set of disruptions in human behaviour across nearly all domains of cognition and affect. Nested within this statement is another related subtlety: not all changes in brain function that are associated with sleep loss are maladaptive and thus represent deficiencies. Instead, some aspects of these neural alterations seem to correlate with preserved task performance, indicating that they may be compensatory and thus adaptive. That the human brain can compensate for SD to a certain degree seems tenable, given that individuals use compensatory effort and behavioural strategies (for example, talking or standing) when attempting to stay awake when sleep deprived. However, the extent and duration of compensatory brain function, which networks and associated operations they are in, and which behaviours are maintained as a consequence, remain poorly characterized. For example, do the effects of SD depend on interactions among hierarchies of functional brain networks, such that deficits or compensation in a fundamental, base-level network (for example, the attention network) dictates respective impairment (or compensation) in higher-level, dependent operations (such as intentional memory encoding or conscious emotional processing)?
Equally important, this Review reveals our current inadequacies of knowledge regarding the sleep- deprived human brain. For example, we have remarkably little understanding of the whole-brain consequences of long-term, chronic sleep loss, as most studies have focused on acute, total SD ( BOX 1 ). Such knowledge would be crucial considering that chronic partial sleep restriction, from weeks to years, is representative of (and thus relevant to) the sleep deficiency observed in the developed world. We also lack any comprehensive understanding of whether and how human brain networks may recover from acute and chronic sleep restriction. Are the underlying neural mechanisms that support recovery from these different forms of sleep loss the same, partially overlapping, or entirely separable? Relatedly, does neural recovery occur across the same time period or over a different temporal duration following different forms and doses of sleep loss? What types of recovery sleep stages and/or aspects of sleep physiology transact functional brain restoration following sleep loss? These questions are important from a societal and public-health perspective, both in professional circumstances in which the privation of sleep is rife (for example, in the military, in aviation and in medicine) and in subtler forms (for example, the public trend of short sleep durations during the week followed by longer sleep durations at weekends).
Another key unresolved issue extends beyond the phenotypic between-participant differences in vulnerability to the neural and behavioural effects of SD within a cognitive domain (such as attention) ( BOX 1 ) and centres on emerging evidence suggesting within-participant, between-domain differences in vulnerability: an individual who is resilient to the effects of SD in one functional domain (such as attention) may conversely be vulnerable to that same dose of sleep loss in other functional domains (such as memory or emotion processing) 130 . This suggests that different brain networks in the same individual may be differentially susceptible to sleep loss. These hypothetical within-subject differences in neural network vulnerability and resilience to SD have not yet been experimentally tested.
Finally, the basic scientific findings regarding sleep loss have not yet been routinely applied in the clinic, despite the examples that we describe in BOX 3 . Sleep abnormalities are robustly observed in every major disorder of the brain, both neurological and psychiatric. Sleep disruption merits recognition as a key relevant factor in these disorders at all levels, from diagnosis and underlying aetiology, to therapy and prevention. More collaborative work between basic and clinical scientists in the field will be necessary to accomplish this goal. Notably, the answers to all these questions have perhaps never been more pressing considering the professional, societal and clinical implications that continue to scale in lockstep with the precipitous decline in sleep duration throughout industrialized nations.

The Philadelphia Eagles are gearing up for their showdown with the Kansas City Chiefs at Super Bowl LVII - a gilt-edged opportunity to land their fifth championship . Three of those championship wins came in the pre-Super Bowl era, which began in 1966. The Birds were crowned NFL champions in 1948, 1949 and 1960 when the competition featured playoffs followed by the Championship Game .
- 1948 Chicago Cardinals 0-7 Philadelphia Eagles (Shibe Park, Philadelphia)
- 1949 Philadelphia Eagles 14-0 Los Angeles Rams (L.A. Memorial Coliseum)
- 1960 Green Bay Packers 13-17 Philadelphia Eagles (Franklin Field, Philadelphia)
But the Eagles have reached the Super Bowl four times since the format was changed. Out of their three previous appearances, they emerged victorious and lifted the trophy just once . Their first Super Bowl appearance was at the XV edition in January 1981. The Eagles were the much-fancied favourites going into the game but suffered a 27-10 defeat to the Oakland Raiders - the first wild card team to clinch the title.
It would be almost a quarter of a century before they were in the same position. At Super Bowl XXXIX in February 2005, the Eagles were pipped to the title by the New England Patriots , losing 24-21 in Jacksonville.
They managed to get their revenge in a return matchup with the Patriots at Super Bowl LII , scoring a 41-33 win over the defending champions at US Bank Stadium in Minneapolis in spite of going into the game as underdogs. QB Nick Foles picked up the MVP award , throwing for 373 yards and three scores while catching a touchdown pass in one of the most memorable moves in Super Bowl history.

Many more criminals are killed or wounded each year by armed citizens than by the police; this proves that owning a gun is possibly the most effective way to protect oneself from crime.
Abstract
Protection of self, of one's loved ones, of one's home and community is the root of the American tradition of gun ownership. It is a concept cherished from the beginning of time and preserved most democratically within the English common law heritage, in which the defense of home, community, and kingdom rested upon an armed and ready populace. A survey conducted by Florida State University Professor Gary Kleck estimates that there were approximately 645,000 defensive uses of handguns against persons per year, excluding police or military uses. The survey also found that guns of all types were used substantially more often defensively than criminally and that gun-wielding civilians in self-defense or some other legally justified cause killed between 1,500 and 2,800 felons annually. The view that potential crime victims run a greater risk of injury if they are armed has been proven groundless. According to U.S. Justice Department victimization studies analyzed by Kleck, for both robbery and assault, victims who used guns for protection were less likely either to be attacked or injured than victims who responded in any other way, including those who did not resist at all; and victims who resisted robbers with guns were less likely to lose their property. A follow-up study of rape found that using a gun or knife for protection reduced the likelihood of a completed rape, and using a gun reduced the likelihood of injury to close to zero. Such resistance also reduces the likelihood of psychological trauma. The decision about whether or not to own a handgun should be made by individual citizens rather than an overprotective government, particularly when the courts have held that governments have no legal responsibility to provide protection when a person's life is threatened.",source_text/c73b56f756a10e3913f2fb35bdbda4efba3c31786147f801e48962d1f5887b97-perplexity_1_0.txt,Gun Ownership Provides Effective Self-Defense,partial_support,True,gun - background - checks - firearms - firearm - ownership - guns - sales - drones - violence,StanfordCitation,0.51,0.47333333333333333,0.46,0.45,[0.02545204944908619],[0.02545204944908619]

In French, it means ""Heart of the Awl,"" referring to the sharpness of the trading skills exhibited by tribal members in their dealings with visitors. The city of Coeur d'Alene, Idaho is named after this tribe.","In French, it means ""Heart of the Awl,"" referring to the sharpness of the trading skills exhibited by tribal members in their dealings with visitors.","The Coeur d’Alene Indian Tribe has a current enrollment of over 2,190 members. The tribe has sovereign authority on a reservation covering 345,000 acres of mountains, lakes, timber and farmland, spanning the western edge of the northern Rocky Mountains and the abundant Palouse country.
The Tribe, like all tribes in America, has a government based on executive, legislative and judicial branches. The tribal council has seven members and operates on a parliamentary system, with members elected by tribal vote and the chairman elected by vote on the council. Although he or she would serve as chief executive, the chairman has one vote on the council and does not have veto power.
The Coeur d’Alene Tribe and all federally recognized tribes in the United States are sovereign in their own lands. That Sovereignty is inherent in the U.S. Constitution, meaning that tribes were recognized as sovereign before the constitution was written. Tribes and the U.S. government have a long series of treaties or executive orders establishing reservations and tribal rights and authorities. Tribal treaty-making also existed with the British, French, Dutch, and Spanish governments before the birth of the United States as an independent nation.
As elected officials, members of this or any tribal council have a unique governing experience. Their responsibilities include maintaining a government-to-government relationship with federal and state governments. The tribal government also must deal with elected officials from city and county governments within the reservation.
Tribal council members meet with members of congress, members of the cabinet, governors and even the president of the United States, resolving issues and conducting government business. However, members of the tribal council must, first and foremost, respond to the needs and issues of tribal membership. Their duties and responsibilities range from their contributions to federal policy and laws to resolving even intra-family disputes on the reservation.
The name, “Coeur d’Alene” was given to the tribe in the late 18th or early 19th century by French traders and trappers. In French, it means “Heart of the Awl,” referring to the sharpness of the trading skills exhibited by tribal members in their dealings with visitors.
In the ancient tribal language, members call themselves, “Schitsu’umsh,” meaning “The Discovered People” or “Those Who Are Found Here.”
The Coeur d’Alene Tribe employs about 1000 people in 16 departments of government or in tribal enterprises. Employees answer to their supervisors or department heads. Department heads answer to the Director of Administration, who answers to the council.
Tribal enterprises include the The Coeur d’ Alene Casino/Hotel operation north of Worley, Idaho. Tribal gaming employs about 500 and generates about $20 million in profits annually, funding programs and creating economic development and diversity. The tribal farm covers about 6,000 acres and produces wheat, barley, peas, lentils, and canola. The tribe also operates the Benewah Automotive Center, the Benewah Market, and Ace Hardware.
The Coeur d’Alene Tribe Wellness Center, Phase III of the Benewah Medical Center , opened in July of 1998. The center, a $5 million facility that covers 43,000 square feet, completes an overall medical operation that is nationally award winning and has evolved to be a national model for both Indian health care and rural health care. The Benewah Medical Center, with phase I opening in 1990, has grown to serve 10,000 patients. It provides services to Indians and non-Indians.
The Coeur d’Alene Tribe has its own tribal school, with a new $5 million facility, which opened in 1997. The tribe’s Department of Education provides programs for adults, including a college degree program in cooperation with Idaho’s Lewis and Clark State College. The Language Department offers classes in the Schitsu’umsh language, teaching tribal members, staff and anyone interested to maintain ancient traditions and culture.
The Coeur d’Alene Tribe has been in this homeland for many thousands of years. The original homeland spans almost five million acres, stretching from Montana in the east to the Spokane River Valley in present day Washington State, from near the Canadian border in the north to near the confluence of the Snake and Clearwater Rivers in north Idaho. Tribal traditions includes a respect and reverence for natural law, and creates a powerful voice for responsible environmental stewardship.",source_text/43e6e527508522c2cdafe0480a43a39b43edfa2d7d0cac9a7a856af7caa0dff7-perplexity_0_0.txt,"In French, it means “Heart of the Awl,” referring to the sharpness of the trading skills exhibited by tribal members in their dealings with visitors.",complete_support,False,song - sang - wrote - sings - movie - played - plays - blood - released - original,StanfordCitation,0.75,0.5533333333333333,0.46,0.45,[0.9968315958976746],[0.9968315958976746]

Shaving cuts happen to the best of us, whether we’re new to shaving or have been doing it for decades. It could be that your blade was too dull, or you slide a little too across with the razor instead of down . Maybe you drew it over top of an ingrown hair or a barely-there mole. Regardless, you’ve got a situation on your hands (or rather, on your face), and you need to get yourself looking presentable, fast.
With all respect to the iconic visual that is the toilet paper method—you know it, and have probably tried it—there are other ways to hygienically and swiftly clot the blood and disinfect the area, while promoting prompt healing all the while. Instead, allow us to share a couple other ways to heal those nicks and cuts—with steps to simultaneously disinfect and heal. (One of them is as easy as applying a little lip balm.)
1. Take a clean washcloth and run it under warm water. Press it against the cut for 30 seconds. The warm water will help clean the cut, and the bleeding should slow meanwhile.
2. Apply a witch hazel-based toner or other alcohol-free aftershave to disinfect the wound. While extremely disinfecting, anything with alcohol will significantly parch the skin instead of promoting healing. Witch hazel toner is a primary post-shave product for this reason: It neutralizes bacteria while also calming skin.
3. Hold an ice cube or cold compress against the cut for 15-30 seconds, to constrict the blood vessels. This should stop bleeding altogether. This is the same logic applied to a post-shave splash of cold water, to help tighten the pores and help the skin retreat from the shave.
4. Apply unused, unscented balm to the nick, to occlude the cut and prevent blood from escaping as well as any germs from creeping in.The best means of delivery is a squeezable tube, so that you know none of the product has been exposed to air or germs (like those on your fingers or lips). If you choose a lip balm stick, though, you can scrape off any part of the chapstick that has touched your lips to remove any germs.)
Use a light hand—and a clean one, if you’re tapping it into place with your fingers. Don’t hesitate to add an extra little mound of balm on this first pass. You’ll clear it away in the next step. If you’re in a hurry out the door, though, then a small, surface amount of balm will suffice, so long as the cut is sealed off.

Alternatively, you can use an antibiotic balm, like Neosporin, for this step. It promotes healing, disinfects, and closes off the wound.
5. Leave it alone for half an hour —no touching, no scrutinizing. Then, gently wipe the excess balm away with your clean fingers. By now, the cut should be done draining, and there should be some balm inside the wound, helping to nurture the nick. You might notice trace redness in the balm from any last blood drainage.

6. Reapply a fresh, barely-there layer of balm, and again throughout the day—and especially at night, before bed. This will expedite healing while continually shutting the wound off from outside threats, like bacteria.
7. In the evening, you can reapply witch hazel after cleansing the face, too. (And before reapplying the balm.) Anything to make sure the cut is closed off.
Alum is one of the most classic, reliable methods of stopping a shave cut. It’s a small brick or pen-shaped tool, made of the mineral potassium alum. It acts like an astringent to dry out and disinfect the targeted area. You might know of it by the terms “styptic pen(cil)” or “styptic block.""
To use them, dampen the tool with cold water, then press it gently against your cut. The alum disinfects the nick and halts further bleeding. Some guys will apply an alum block against the entire shaved region (as an aftershave remedy), to prevent razor burn and ingrown hairs. We suggest using an aftershave lotion instead, and saving the alum for proper nicks and cuts, to prevent overdrying the skin.

When the fruit trees in Arles are in bloom in the spring of 1888, Van Gogh paints them nearly every day. Thus, in a short period he produces fourteen paintings and several drawings and sketches of the blossoming trees. He considers Pink peach trees one of the most successful in the series.
Anton Mauve
In the evening of the day on which Van Gogh makes this painting, he finds a letter from his sister, who writes to tell him that Anton Mauve has died. This painter was not only his cousin by marriage ; he also taught him to paint in oils and watercolour. Van Gogh decides to dedicate the work to him.
Tender and cheerful
He writes to his brother Theo that he was moved and affected by the news, ‘and I wrote on my painting Souvenir de Mauve Vincent & Theo and if you think it’s good as it stands we’ll send it to Mrs Mauve in both our names. (...) It seemed to me that in memory of Mauve we needed something that was both tender and very cheerful and not a study in a more serious key than that’.

Stephen Curry holds the record for most three-pointers in an NBA Finals game with nine.",Stephen Curry holds the record for most three-pointers in an NBA Finals game with nine.,"Who holds the record for the most 3-pointers in a game in NBA history?
Remember, before Stephen Curry made the three-point shot part of the lexicon , some of the greatest NBA players never really relied on shooting from beyond the arc.
Michael Jordan hit 581 3-point shots throughout his legendary 15-year career. His single-season high was matched two times with a mere 111 successful 3-pointers.
20 Worst NBA players of all-time

During his career, Larry Bird was considered the best long-range shooter in the NBA. What was his single-season high? Ninety. Yeah, 90 !
Below, we look at the record for the most 3-pointers in an NBA game. The focus is on five different players from the modern era, including Mr. Curry himself.
- Klay Thompson, 2018: 14
- Stephen Curry, 2016: 13
- Zach Lavine, 2019: 13
- Kobe Bryant, 2003: 12
- Donyell Marshall, 2005: 12
It was back on October 29 of 2018 that Klay Thompson lit the Windy City on fire. Taking on the Bulls, this Golden State Warriors star nailed 10 3-pointers in the first half alone. It’s a game that saw Golden State lead by the score of 92-50 at the half.
It’s astonishing. Thompson didn’t have much of a chance to add to his total in the second half with Golden State up by a ton. With that said, he was able to hit four more in the second half to best teammate Klay Thompson for the most 3’s in a game.
All said, Thompson connected on 18-of-29 from the field. That included a 14-of-24 mark from distance en route to scoring 52 points. Amazingly, this is not the signature moment of the three-time NBA champion’s career.
Two years before Thompson broke the record for the most 3-pointers in a game, the most-lethal 3-point shooter in NBA history topped the charts. It’s no surprise given that Curry now boasts the record for the current NBA 3-point record in his career.
This specific game came against the New Orleans Pelicans on November 7, 2016. It also came in Oakland’s Oracle Arena, sending Warriors fans into a frenzy.
Curry would hit on 13-of-17 from 3-point range en route to scoring 46 points. That 77% mark from distance is just insane. The rest of Golden State’s roster, Thompson and Kevin Durant included, were a combined 3-of-18 from distance. Golden State needed it all in a 10-point win against Anthony Davis and the Pels.
When LaVine entered the NBA as a first-round pick of the Minnesota Timberwolves back in 2014, most saw him as a mere athlete. The former Slam Dunk Contest winner was never going to morph into an elite-level player.
That changed when the UCLA product was dealt from Minnesota to Chicago in the now-infamous Jimmy Butler trade ahead of the 2017-18 season.
In his third full season with Chicago, LaVine averaged a career-best 25.5 points per game. He also shot 38% from 3-point range. One particular moment comes to mind in LaVine’s ascension to superstardom.
Taking on the Charlotte Hornets back in November of 2019, LaVine tied Curry for the second-most 3-pointers in a game. He nailed on 13-of-17 from distance, scoring 49 points in the process. What’s crazy here is the fact that LaVine played less than 35 minutes.
The Black Mamba was a living bucket during his all-time geat career. The then-Seattle Sonics found that it out back on January 7, 2003, in Los Angeles.
Not necessarily known for his 3-point shot during that stage in his career, the late-great Bryant absolutely torched Gary Payton and Co. by hitting on 12-of-18 from 3-point range. That broke the previous record for the most 3-pointers in a game — held by Dennis Scott.
Three years later, and Bryant would score 81 points in a game against the Toronto Raptors — bringing up memories of the great Wilt Chamberlain in the process. Interestingly enough, he hit only seven 3-pointers in that game.
Despite his status as an all-time great, Bryant’s single-season high for 3-pointers was 180 back in 2005-06. That’s tied for 208th overall in league history.
It’s not that Marshall wasn’t a big name coming out of Connecticut back in 1994. He was the No. 4 overall pick of the Minnesota Timberwolves.
Unfortunately, he didn’t have the career of those selected immediately ahead of him (Glenn Robinson, Jason Kidd and Grant Hill).
But for at least one game, Marshall stood above the rest. As a member of the Toronto Raptors during the 2005-06 season, Marshall nailed 12-of-19 3-pointers against the Philadelphia 76ers.
The crazy thing here is that it came off the bench for a team that included Chris Bosh and Jalen Rose. It also came against a 76ers squd that featured Allen Iverson and Andre Iguodala.
For his career, Marshall connected on 902 3-point attempts. That’s good for 168th in league history — sandwiched in between Rasual Butler and Jared Dudley. Yeah, we have to love the randomness of Donyell Marshall.
Stephen Curry holds the mark for the most career NBA 3-pointers. He also hold the mark for the most 3-pointers in a season and boasts four of the five seasons with the most in league history. So, why not have this extend to the All-Star Game?
It was back in February that Curry awed onlookers in Cleveland by nailing the most 3-pointers in a game. After Cavaliers fans had booed him during pre-game introductions, Curry went nuclear .
We’re not kidding. The dude hit 16-of-27 from distance. He was nailing them from Akron. Almost literally. It was a sight to behold. And while it’s not an official NBA 3-point record, it was stunning to watch.
NBA players have nailed double-digit three-pointers a total of 74 times. Of the 29 players who have hit 11 or more from distance, Curry has done it 12 times.
This just goes to show us how much he’s transformed the game. With the likes of youngsters Trae Young and Anthony Edwards doing their thing from distance, his records will fall at some point.
Stephen Curry of the Golden State Warriors boast the record with nine three-pointers in an NBA Finals game. It took place in Game 2 of the 2018 NBA Finals against the Cleveland Cavaliers. Curry scored 33 points in the game, eventually leading the Warriors to a four-game series sweep.

Some argue that nuclear weapons are a threat to global security and should be eliminated, while others believe that they serve as a deterrent against aggression. The overall inventory of nuclear weapons is declining globally, but the pace of reductions is slowing compared with the past 30 years.","The overall inventory of nuclear weapons is declining globally, but the pace of reductions is slowing compared with the past 30 years.","Despite progress in reducing nuclear weapon arsenals since the Cold War, the world’s combined inventory of nuclear warheads remains at a very high level: nine countries possessed roughly 12,500 warheads as of early-2023.
Combined, the United States and Russia now possess approximately 89 percent of the world’s total inventory of nuclear weapons, and 86 percent of the stockpiled warheads available for use by the military. Currently, no other nuclear-armed state sees a need for more than a few hundred nuclear weapons for national security, although many of these states are increasing their nuclear stockpiles.
Globally, the overall inventory of nuclear weapons is declining, but the pace of reductions is slowing compared with the past 30 years. Moreover, these reductions are happening only because the United States and Russia are still dismantling previously retired warheads.
In contrast to the overall inventory of nuclear weapons, the number of warheads in global military stockpiles––which comprises warheads assigned to operational forces––is increasing once again. The United States is still reducing its nuclear stockpile slowly. France and Israel have relatively stable inventories. But China, India, North Korea, Pakistan and the United Kingdom, as well as possibly Russia, are all thought to be increasing their stockpiles (see map):

Of the world’s approximate 12,500 nuclear warheads, roughly 9,576 are in the military stockpiles for use by missiles, aircraft, ships and submarines. The remaining warheads have been retired but are still relatively intact and are awaiting dismantlement). Of the 9,576 warheads in the military stockpiles, some 3,804 are deployed with operational forces (on missiles or bomber bases). Of those, approximately 2,000 US, Russian, British and French warheads are on high alert , ready for use on short notice (see table):
The exact number of nuclear weapons in each country’s possession is a closely held national secret, so the estimates presented here come with significant uncertainty. Most nuclear-armed states provide essentially no information about the sizes of their nuclear stockpiles. Yet the degree of secrecy varies considerably from country to country. Between 2010 and 2018, the United States disclosed its total stockpile size, but in 2019 the Trump administration stopped that practice . In 2020, the Biden administration restored nuclear transparency – a brief victory for nuclear accountability in a democratic country – but then declined to declassify any US stockpile data for 2021 or 2022. Similarly, in 2021 the United Kingdom announced that it would no longer disclose public figures for its operational stockpile, deployed warhead or deployed missile numbers. Additionally, as of 2023 both the United States and Russia have elected to no longer exchange publicly-available data about their deployed strategic warheads and launchers as mandated by the New START Treaty.
Despite these limitations, however, publicly available information, careful analysis of historical records, and occasional leaks make it possible to make best estimates about the size and composition of the national nuclear weapon stockpiles. For a breakdown of the nuclear warhead categories of the different nuclear-armed states, and for links to more details overviews of each country’s arsenals, see this table:

How to read this table: “Deployed strategic warheads” are those deployed on intercontinental missiles and at heavy bomber bases. “Deployed nonstrategic warheads” are those deployed on bases with operational short-range delivery systems. “Reserve/Nondeployed” warheads are those not deployed on launchers but in storage (weapons at bomber bases are considered deployed). The “military stockpile” includes active and inactive warheads that are in the custody of the military and earmarked for use by commissioned deliver vehicles. The “total inventory” includes warheads in the military stockpile as well as retired, but still intact, warheads in the queue for dismantlement. For additional guidance, see endnotes below ( note: as estimates are updated, they may vary from the printed materials below ).
In historical context, the number of nuclear weapons in the world has declined significantly since the Cold War: down from a peak of approximately 70,300 in 1986 to an estimated 12,500 in early-2023. Government officials often characterize that accomplishment as a result of current or recent arms control agreements, but in reality the overwhelming portion of the reduction happened in the 1990s. Some also compare today’s numbers with those of the 1950s, but that is like comparing apples and oranges; today’s forces are vastly more capable.
The pace of reduction has slowed significantly compared with the 1990s and appears to continue only because of dismantlement of retired weapons; the trend is that the military stockpiles (useable nuclear weapons) are increasing again.
Instead of planning for nuclear disarmament, the nuclear-armed states appear to plan to retain large arsenals for the indefinite future. As such, they’re in conflict with the objective and spirit of the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons.
All continue to modernize their remaining nuclear forces at a significant pace, several are adding new types and/or increasing the role they serve in national strategy and public statements, and all appear committed to retaining nuclear weapons for the indefinite future.
For an overview of global modernization programs, see our contributions to the SIPRI Yearbook and the Nuclear Weapons Ban Monitor . Individual country profiles are available from the FAS Nuclear Notebook .
The information available for each country varies greatly, ranging from the most transparent nuclear weapons state (United States) to the most opaque (Israel). Accordingly, while the stockpile estimate for the United States is based on “real” numbers, the estimates for several of the other nuclear-armed states are highly uncertain.
These nuclear weapons estimates are produced by Hans M. Kristensen, Matt Korda, and Eliana Reynolds of the Federation of American Scientists.

No matter how many years pass, you can recall exactly how you felt as you sat on the sofa or in the cinema, immersed in a world unlike anything you had ever seen before.
When asking audiences about their most special first-time viewings, you often hear the likes of Avatar , 2001: A Space Odyssey , Avengers: Endgame, and others brought up as the speaker becomes increasingly wide-eyed, embracing nostalgia.
While these are great shouts, for many, nothing will compare to their first encounter with Lana and Lilly Wachowski’s The Matrix.
Arriving in 1999, it changed the game and influenced the landscape of action cinema forever. It was refreshing in so many ways, with many of its details swiftly flooding popular culture like a sea of sentinels.
One of The Matrix’s most iconic moments is the red pill or blue pill sequence, so let’s get it explained…
The scene in question sees Neo (played by Keanu Reeves) offered the choice between a red or blue pill by Morpheus (Laurence Fishburne)
Each pill represents something, with the red pill as the path of finding out the truth behind the lies, providing the opportunity to forever change your knowledge and perception of reality.
Taking the blue pill instead, on the other hand, is to choose a life of ignorance, refusing to shatter the illusion you’re living in.
In the context of the film, taking the red pill means that Neo will discover he is basically a slave to a dream world sculpted by machines. Of course, there is no going back after learning something so shocking. If he were to take the blue pill, he would continue to live in this comfortable simulation, but ultimately, it’s a prison
Morpheus describes the choice in the film as follows:
“You take the blue pill…the story ends, you wake up in your bed and believe whatever you want to believe. You take the red pill…you stay in Wonderland, and I show you how deep the rabbit hole goes.”
With this in mind, and to those unfamiliar with The Matrix, it’s worth asking… did Neo take the red or the blue pill?
Neo decides to take the red pill and venture deeper down the rabbit hole, rather than remaining clueless.
His actions mean that he learns all about the nature of the Matrix, lifting the veil on this fabricated “reality”. You probably guessed that he took the red pill though; perhaps it would’ve been a pretty boring film if he’d gone blue.
Recently, fans were given the same choice as Neo over on The Matrix Resurrections website . Users are presented with a red and blue pill, asked to choose one. By clicking on both, you can check out two teasers for the forthcoming fourth installment.
Over the years, many fans have suggested the theory that The Matrix movies are actually metaphors for transgender identity.
Essentially, some audiences believe that Neo’s alienation in the simulation is akin to gender dysphoria, with the red pill standing in for estrogen pills.
Lilly and Lana Wachowski came out as trans in 2012 and 2016, respectively, and Lilly Wachowski has since confirmed that this allegory was the directorial duo’s “original intention”.
In conversation with Netflix Film Club , she explained: “I’m glad that it has gotten out that that was the original intention. The world wasn’t quite ready for it. The corporate world wasn’t ready for it.”",source_text/f728b109078e4b5e2e99c3bdc8c6f63a236487574960106bade687d2a800ab23-neeva_1_0.txt,"Each pill represents something, with the red pill as the path of finding out the truth behind the lies, providing the opportunity to forever change your knowledge and perception of reality.",complete_support,False,song - sang - wrote - sings - movie - played - plays - blood - released - original,StanfordCitation,0.83,0.5933333333333333,0.49,0.46,[0.9831225275993347],[0.9831225275993347]

Kinstler and Spence are two powerhouse vocalists, while Beckham has the potential to become a country music superstar.
However, given that American Idol contestants are typically either teenagers or in their 20s, how old are this year’s three finalists? Here’s a look at the singers and each of their ages.

During the May 16 episode that featured the top four contestants, fans said goodbye to Casey Bishop, a rocker from Estero, Florida. Bishop showed her wide range of abilities while on the show, performing Mötley Crüe’s “Live Wire,” while also singing “Over The Rainbow,” but she was unable to outlast Kinstler, Spence, and Beckham.
According to her American Idol bio , Kinstler is a college student from Lakewood, Illinois. She has limitless range and has proven it throughout the season by successfully singing Demi Lovato multiple times in addition to having several other standout performances.
Spence, on the other hand, is from Douglas, Georgia. His stardom has reached another level on the show, as he had already become popular while in high school when a video of him singing “Diamonds” by Rhianna went viral. Like Kinstler, Spence has also proven that he has limitless range and is a strong vocalist.
Lastly, Beckham is from Apple Valley, California. He has a voice perfect for country radio and has a chance to be on it for a long time. He has also shown that he is a talented songwriter, as he has performed multiple originals this season.
American Idol contestants can only be between 14 and 28 years old, per the show’s eligibility requirements . So, how old are this year’s three finalists?
According to their bios, Kinstler is the youngest of the three, as she is 20 years old. Spence is just barely older than her, as he is 21, and Beckham is the oldest of the three at 24 years old.
While all them are in their 20s, Bishop was certainly the youngest of the top four, as she is 16 years old.

It’s hard to determine which contestant has the best chance to win, as they are all in the final three for different reasons.
For much of the season, it seemed as if Kinstler and Spence were the favorites, but Beckham has come on strong at the end. According to Parade, his single “23” even reached the top of the iTunes charts after its release on May 14.
“It is all I ever wanted in my life, to put out music that people listen to,” Beckham, who wrote the song, said to Parade . “So, I am grateful that with this song I was able to do that. What a blessing from the point that I wrote it to the point I am at now—the way that my life has changed and a lot of it has to do with that song.”
Each American Idol finalist certainly has a great chance to win, but Beckham’s top-rated single may help his chances.

Take a Look ↓↓↓
Of course, we know this isn’t the question of all questions, and many people probably didn’t even know a pickle was a cucumber until they saw that sentence.
What is a conundrum, however, is the questions that arise over the status of the pickle and cucumber. Are they fruit? Perhaps a vegetable? Maybe they are a berry. Or, perhaps they are all three!
In this article, we will be delving deep into the world of pickles and discovering whether they are a fruit, or whether they have some other status. However, in order to do this, we must first establish what a pickle even is.
Nope, it’s not a trick question, and it will all become clear in just a second, so keep on reading….
The term pickle is in itself very confusing. If you ask for a pickle in every country of the world, you will not always be given the same thing. In the UK for example you will likely be handed a pickled onion (imagine a minuscule white onion in vinegar).
Here in the States, you will be given a small green cucumber in vinegar. In Korea, you may get kimchi or some pickled ginger. Some countries may even give you pickled beetroot, and even a pickled boiled egg!
Then you get the pickles that resemble sauce. For example, sandwich pickles (think of popular British brands such as Branston pickles), and piccalilli are all examples of different types of pickles!
Suffice to say, it is confusing! However, all ‘pickle’ refers to is the act of pickling which is when a food is fermented in vinegar, alongside salt, various herbs and spices, and sugar. Of course, it is most common to see these small green cucumbers, and they are sold worldwide.
However, many other vegetables, and even fruits and nuts can be pickles, too. The aforementioned piccalilli often has pickled cauliflower among other vegetables.
For the sake of clarity, in the article when we refer to the term ‘pickle’ we mean these.
As you will have read, pickles in this context are small green cucumbers (also known as pickled gherkins ). This tells you that they are related to the cucumber at least in some way
Pickles are actually cucumbers that have been grown to be that size, specifically for the purposes of pickling. In all ways but size, they are exactly like the large cucumbers you can buy in a store for your salad . They have high water content and a fresh taste.
When they are pickled they are kept in a mixture of vinegar, often with salt, sugar, and other herbs or spices added such as dill. This preserves the cucumber and gives them a moreish, sour taste that is so loved by people all over the globe.
They are either kept whole in jars where they can be eaten or used in a dip, or they are pre sliced where they can be used in burgers, on pizzas, in a salad, and in many more recipes.
As you have probably guessed by now, pickles (at least in this context) are indeed cucumbers. That is, they start their life as a cucumber before being picked and pickled to turn into the sour green snacks that we all know and love.
Because they have not reached the full size of a cucumber, many people may refer to them as baby cucumbers or simply small cucumbers.
However, it is important to remember that the term ‘pickle’ is a generalization and is given to any food that has been pickled such as pickled onion, pickled egg, and pickled ginger. So, not all pickles are cucumbers , but all cucumbers can be turned into pickles (confused yet?).
That being said, it is highly likely that if you ask for a pickle whilst you are in America, you will be bright out a small pickled cucumber. If you want to save the confusion in other parts of the world you can simply ask for a gherkin and you will be brought out the same thing.
Now, in order to establish the answer to the question asked at the beginning of the article, we must first get an idea as to what a cucumber is. By asking ‘is a pickle a fruit?’ you are also asking ‘is a cucumber a fruit?’.
Let’s find out the answer to that now, shall we? In order to answer this as thoroughly as possible, we should first establish the difference between a fruit and a vegetable.
We know this sounds super condescending but trust us when we essay there is a reason for this in order to establish whether a cucumber (and by default, a pickle) is a fruit, we must gain a better understanding of what the difference is between a fruit and a vegetable.
The obvious answer that springs to the mind of most people we ask is that fruit is sweet and a vegetable is savory. This is definitely the most common way of identifying one from the other, and certainly, from a culinary perspective, it is correct. However, from a botanical perspective, the difference is a little more confusing.
The botanical definition of a vegetable is that it is something that comes from a plant that can be consumed by a human. This includes all parts of the plant such as the leaves, flowers, roots, stems, seeds, and fruit. Yep, you read that correctly - fruit.
This means that from the perspective of botany, the fruit of a plant is a vegetable.
What this indicates is that ‘vegetable’ is a broad term used to discuss any part of a plant that is edible for consumption by a human.
So, by this example, a cucumber is technically a vegetable in the sense that it is an edible plant safe for consumption by humans. However, the definition doesn’t stop there. Keep on reading to find out what we mean by ‘fruit’.
Botanically speaking, a fruit is the part of a flowering plant that bears a seed. The fruit is, technically, the seed. Now, by this definition, not every fruit is edible. Just think of the number of flowering plants out there that bear seeds in this way - not all of them are safe for eating!
From a culinary perspective, a fruit is an edible food that typically has seeds inside. For example, an apple, an orange, a pear, a lemon, and a peach would all classify as fruit. Technically, a banana cannot be included on this list as it does not contain a seed. In fact, a banana is a berry (more on this later).
With this definition of fruit in mind, it is clear that a cucumber must also be included on the ‘fruit’ list. This is because the cucumber is the fruit of a flowering plant and has seeds inside!
So, with this in mind, a cucumber - and by definition, a pickle - is both a member of the vegetable family and the fruit family. To complicate this, even more, we have the culinary definitions of fruit and vegetables to consider.
Because of the fact that cucumbers do not have a sweet taste, they are often not counted as fruit in terms of the culinary perspective. Instead, they are treated as a vegetable.
But wait, that’s not all! We can complicate this even further by defining the term ‘berry’ for you!
A berry is a bit of a funny one to try and explain! Many people will be sat there thinking “but isn’t a berry a type of fruit?”. You are not wrong!
Typically, the term fruit brings to mind an abundance of colorful foods, with berries taking center stage. For example, strawberries, blueberries, and raspberries are some of the most popular fruits in countries all over the world. However, they are actually not even berries!
In the botanical sense, a berry is a name given to the fruit of a plant that does not have a pit. By this, we mean that they are produced from one single flower. This means that the plant has one single ovary!
So, in a technical and botanical sense, any fruit that comes from a flowering plant with only one ovary is a berry. This also means that any fruit that comes from a plant with multiple ovaries is not a berry.
By this definition, raspberries and strawberries are actually not berries at all, because they come from a flowering plant that has multiple ovaries.
However, from a culinary perspective, berries are very different from this botanical definition. Raspberries, blueberries, blackberries, and strawberries are all the most commonly known and used ‘berries’, but not one of them is a true berry in the botanical sense. However, from a culinary understanding, these are all classed as berries.
On the other hand, some very surprising fruits and vegetables are technically classed as berries. These include bananas, kiwifruits, redcurrants, tomatoes, eggplants, watermelons, pumpkins (yes, really!), and of course, the humble cucumber.
This means that the cucumber is not just a vegetable, not just a fruit, but also a berry. In turn, this also means that a pickle is technically all of these things, too.
So, in conclusion, we wanted to draw your attention back to the original reason for this article. We have been on a rollercoaster ride of botanical and culinary definitions.
Suffice to say that it is difficult to give a definitive answer to whether a pickle is a fruit. In truth, a pickle could be seen as a fruit, vegetable, or berry, depending on your perspective. In fact, you can see it as all three!
Conversely, many people may actually prefer to call it none of the above, since technically it is only the cucumber that belongs to all of these three groups. The pickle, by contrast, is made using a cucumber but also has other vital components such as vinegar, salt, sugar, and spices.
As well as this, to say that ‘all pickles are fruits’ is incorrect when you consider our earlier definition of a pickle and the fact that it does not solely refer to a pickled cucumber, but a whole host of other pickled foods.
In our opinion, the pickle (and in this context we mean the small pickled cucumber) is indeed a fruit, but it is also a berry and a vegetable, too. How you view the pickle is your choice entirely, and whether you call it a fruit, a vegetable, a berry, or nothing at all, then you are still correct!
We hope this article has been useful to you and that you learned something new and interesting! Now you know the next time you bite into a kosher dill pickle or get inspired with a new pickle recipe .

The Cyber Kill Chain offers a comprehensive framework as a part of the Intelligence Driven Defense model . In this article, we will discuss what the cyber kill chain is and what its steps are.
Cyber intrusions are the worst nightmare of many of us. That is why many cyber security professionals and developers offer unique solutions for the identification and prevention of cyber intrusions activity. Being one of those developers, Lockheed Martin has brought the Cyber Kill Chain into our lives. In this article, we will explain what Cyber Kill Chain is in great detail and also provide a comprehensive, 7-step guide. Keep reading to learn!
The term “ kill chain ” was first used as a military concept that defines the structure of an attack that covers:
- The identification of the target
- The force dispatch towards the target
- The decision and order to attack the target
- The destruction of the target
The idea of interrupting the opponent’s kill chain activity is often employed as a defence. Inspired by the whole kill chain concept, Lockheed Martin (an aerospace, security, arms, defence and advanced technologies company based in the United States of America) created the Cyber Kill Chain. It is a cybersecurity framework that offers a method to deal with the intrusions on a computer network.
Since it first emerged, the Cyber Kill Chain has evolved significantly in order to anticipate and recognize insider threats much better, detect various other attack techniques like advanced ransomware and social engineering.
The Cyber Kill Chain consists of seven steps that aim to offer a better attack visibility while supporting the cyberattack / cybersecurity analyst to get a better understanding of the adversary’s tactics, procedures and techniques. The seven steps of the Cyber Kill Chain illustrates the different phases of a cyberattack starting from reconnaissance, reaching to the exfiltration.
The Cyber Kill Chain consists of 7 steps: Reconnaissance, weaponization, delivery, exploitation, installation, command and control, and finally, actions on objectives. Below you can find detailed information on each.
1. Reconnaissance: In this step, the attacker / intruder chooses their target. Then they conduct an in-depth research on this target to identify its vulnerabilities that can be exploited.
2. Weaponization: In this step, the intruder creates a malware weapon like a virus, worm or such in order to exploit the vulnerabilities of the target. Depending on the target and the purpose of the attacker, this malware can exploit new, undetected vulnerabilities (also known as the zero-day exploits ) or it can focus on a combination of different vulnerabilities.
3. Delivery: This step involves transmitting the weapon to the target. The intruder / attacker can employ different methods like USB drives, e-mail attachments and websites for this purpose.
4. Exploitation: In this step, the malware starts the action. The program code of the malware is triggered to exploit the target’s vulnerability/vulnerabilities.
5. Installation: In this step, the malware installs an access point for the intruder / attacker. This access point is also known as the backdoor.
6. Command and Control: The malware gives the intruder / attacker access in the network/system.
7. Actions on Objective: Once the attacker / intruder gains persistent access, they finally take action to fullfil their purpose, such as encryption for ransom, data exfiltration or even data destruction .

Greg grits his teeth and takes a deep breath. ""Be calm,"" he tells himself. ""Don't let it get to you. It's just Carl being Carl.""
But Greg has been gritting his teeth for months now, and he's finding Carl's irritating behavior increasingly disruptive and distracting. There's the frequent cursing, the ""reply all"" to emails, the smelly sandwiches, and the black hole of scattered papers that is his desk.
Greg doesn't know what to do. Should he continue to ignore it and pretend everything's fine? Confront Carl? Talk to his supervisor? Go to HR? Or maybe even look for a job in another department?
Click here to view a transcript of this video.
In this article, we look at the damaging impact that persistent, irritating behaviors like Carl's can have on workplace relationships , team morale, and performance. We'll also explore strategies that you can use to tackle them.
Irritating behavior can be defined as a person's annoying habits that bother you often and, eventually, drain your energy and morale. Examples might include:
- Talking loudly on the phone.
- Always interrupting people.
- Being disruptive during group sessions.
- Leaving it to others to clear away after a meeting.
- Failing to file documents correctly.
- Eating loudly.
- Taking frequent cigarette breaks.
- Wearing inappropriate clothing.
- Cutting or chewing fingernails.
- Referring to people in terms they don't like.
Often, these behaviors are perceived to be unimportant and so go unchallenged. You might feel that you'll come across as a ""killjoy"" if you ask a colleague to change what they're doing, particularly if it doesn't seem to bother anyone else and it isn't affecting his or her ability to work.
But failing to address such issues can leave you feeling helpless, deflated and miserable. Eventually, that niggling little habit can become a major distraction, and it may cause resentment and anger to build up. This can threaten personal and team relationships, and impact your productivity.
In this section, we look at seven tips for tackling a co-worker's irritating behavior in a tactful but assertive way.
It can be easy to vent your frustration about your irritating colleague by complaining about him to another co-worker. But spreading rumors in this way can be divisive and destructive. Not only that, but you might find that it backfires on you, and you could end up looking like the ""bad guy.""
Gossiping can also lead to much more serious behavioral issues, such as exclusion, harassment, bullying , or discrimination . These can result in formal disciplinary action, and even dismissal.
What we find irritating can be very subjective. So, before you decide how to approach the problem, take a step back and look at it objectively. How much does your colleague's behavior really affect you? Do other people on your team seem bothered by it? Do you feel able to cope with it on your own? Or, do you need to refer it to your manager?
The level of action that you take should correspond to how serious you feel his behavior to be. If he persistently talks loudly on the phone, for instance, perhaps you could just wear earplugs or politely ask him to ""keep it down."" But, if you think his behavior is aggressive or damaging, then you'll likely need to refer the matter to your manager or HR department.
It can be hard to keep your emotions in check when you're faced with persistent, irritating behavior, and ""bottling them up"" can often make things worse. But, remember that it's the behavior that's the issue, not the person. Your colleague is likely unaware of the impact her annoying habit is having on you.
Keep your emotions under control when you confront her. Be tactful , and make the conversation as work-focused as possible. Assert how you feel, but avoid making it personal, as this may cause her to become defensive or angry.
For example, you could say: ""Hey, Dina, I love your taste in music but I'm on a tight deadline today and really need to focus. Any chance you could turn it down, just for a while, please?""
Give your colleague the benefit of the doubt. A messy desk, for example, could be a sign that he is struggling to organize his work . Noisy phone calls could be the result of hearing loss . And poor asset management could be due to a lack of training.
His behavior might be down to something you haven't considered, such as cultural differences . If so, you'll need to tread carefully. You don't want to come across as insensitive or discriminatory.
Start a savvy conversation with your colleague. Be open and honest with her about how you feel, but also show respect, and listen to her reply with empathy and without judgment. Savvy conversations are designed to enable people to talk freely with each other in a way that avoids conflict or distrust.
If tensions do run high, try asking an impartial colleague to mediate the discussion. Mediation is an informal conflict-resolution tool that can help to improve trust and team relationships.
If behavior shifts from being irritating to serious – in cases of persistent lateness or bullying, for example – it becomes a performance or disciplinary issue. In these circumstances, it's best that you let your manager or HR take the lead.
If you think that a colleague's irritating behavior is unlikely to change, or you choose to ignore it, make sure that you have adequate coping strategies.
Try deep breathing exercises or mindfulness to help to keep calm and focused. Or, if it's a ""noisy neighbor"" that's the problem, you could try using earplugs or noise-canceling headphones. Perhaps you could change desks, or adjust your workstation to make his irritating behavior less visible or distracting.
It's important that you take seriously any team member's complaint about a colleague's irritating behavior. You may have observed the problem yourself, or perhaps other people have raised similar complaints. But you need to be seen to be fair, and not to leap to conclusions.
If the person's performance is otherwise exemplary, the accusations could actually be the result of jealousy. Talk to her about her working relationships and listen empathically to her response. Reassure her that you will not accept bullying behavior and that you are committed to resolving the situation.
However, if her irritating habit does need to be addressed, be frank with her and make clear what your organization considers to be acceptable and unacceptable behavior. Share and discuss any code of conduct with all of your team to show that the individual is not being singled out or victimized.
Be sure to review the situation, in case she continues the irritating behavior and its impact grows. Then, you might consider using more formal conflict resolution, such as the Interest-Based Relational Approach . And if matters still don't improve, refer your concerns to HR.
Chances are, you have quirks or habits that really bug one of your co-workers! It can come as an unpleasant surprise to learn this, and you may feel a range of emotions, from embarrassment and shock to anger and shame. But try to avoid reacting negatively, and use the following approaches to deal with the issue calmly and rationally:
- Empathize. Try to see the situation from the other person's perspective and ask him to clarify what has annoyed him. For example, you might think you're being helpful by offering your advice to two colleagues mid-conversation, but if you do this regularly you might get a reputation for ""butting in.""
- Be aware of body language. Do you ever get the feeling that someone just isn't happy with you? She's not specifically said anything, but there's that nagging feeling that something isn't quite right. Nonverbal actions like tone of voice, sighs, eye-rolls, shrugs, or folded arms can signal that a person is reacting negatively to something you're doing or saying. If this happens, try using open body language and tone of voice to show that you are willing to discuss the problem.
- Think positively. Recognize that working to adjust your behavior could improve your wider performance and team relationships. This will likely have a positive impact on your reputation and career progression.
- Ask yourself, ""Is this fair?"" Complaints needn't be personal attacks. So, be assertive if you feel that a co-worker's criticisms are unreasonable, or if you think that his manner is aggressive. If you feel uncomfortable challenging him, especially if he is your boss, seek advice from HR or, if appropriate, a trusted peer.
- Use self-reflection. Evaluating your own conduct objectively can help you to judge whether you are acting in a way that's respectful and appropriate to your workplace. You might have unwittingly fallen into negative, complacent or lazy behaviors that are having a poor effect on those around you. If this is the case, set a good example and adapt your working style.
Key Points
Irritating behavior is persistent, annoying, but apparently minor. Ignoring it, or tackling it carelessly, can negatively affect you and your team's morale, relationships and performance. So, follow these seven tips to improve the situation:
- Avoid Gossip.
- Assess the Impact.
- Be Tactful.
- Consider Any Underlying Causes.
- Be Honest and Open.
- Seek Support.
- Develop Coping Mechanisms.
If you manage a team in which a complaint has been raised, avoid leaping to conclusions and be seen to treat everyone fairly.
Finally, if someone criticizes you for being irritating, try to adjust your behavior in a positive way. But, if you think the complaint is unfair, say so!

It is situated in Lough Gill, a lake in Yeats’s home county of Sligo, Ireland. It is a very small, uninhabited island. William Butler Yeats wrote “The Lake Isle of Innisfree” in 1888.","It is a very small, uninhabited island.","First published in the collection The Rose in 1893, “The Lake Isle of Innisfree” is an example of Yeats’s earlier lyric poems. Throughout the three short quatrains the poem explores the speaker’s longing for the peace and tranquility of his boyhood haunt, Innisfree.
“The Lake Isle of Innisfree” suggests that a life of simplicity in nature will bring peace to the troubled speaker. However, the poem is the speaker’s recollection of Innisfree, and therefore the journey is an emotional and spiritual escape rather than an actual one. Innisfree may be a symbol for the speaker’s passed youth, which the speaker is unable to return to in the “real,” or physical, world. Emotionally, the speaker can return again and again to the tranquility of Innisfree.
Born June 13, 1865, in Sandymount, Ireland, to John Butler Yeats, a lawyer turned portrait painter, and Susan Mary Pollexfen, daughter of a well-to-do shipping family, William Butler Yeats was raised in London and Dublin, attending schools in both cities. Though passionate about art, Yeats turned to writing after reading Irish poets Samuel Ferguson and James Clarence Mangan. His own interest in all things Irish can be seen in poems such as his popular and early poem,“The Lake Isle of Innisfree,” in which he expresses his longing to return to
County Sligo in western Ireland, where he spent much of his youth. Yeats’s chief influences included his father; John O’Leary (1830–1907), an Irish nationalist and activist; and Maud Gonne, a fiery Irish revolutionary with whom the poet fell in love and maintained a long correspondence. Yeats celebrated Gonne’s beauty in verse and plays throughout his life, though the two never married. A writer who was inspired by mysticism and occult philosophy as much as Irish literature and folklore, Yeats was deeply involved in organizations such as the Hermetic Students of the Golden Dawn and the Theosophical Society , the latter founded by Madam Blavatsky, a controversial mystic. A lifelong student of philosophy and literature, Yeats was well read in writers such as Plato, Dante, Shakespeare, Ben Johnson, John Donne , Jonathan Swift , William Blake , Immanuel Kant , and Friedrich Nietzsche.
A shy youth, Yeats grew into a charismatic figure, championing Irish heritage and resisting the cultural influence of English rule. A playwright as well as a poet, Yeats, along with a patron, Lady Gregory of Coole Park, founded the Irish Theatre, which became the Abbey Theatre . He served as the Abbey’s lead playwright and later was joined by John Synge, author of The Playboy of the Western World . Many of Yeats’s plays drew on Irish legends and include The Countess Cathleen (1892); The Land of Heart’s Desire (1894); Cathleen ni Houlihan (1902); The King’s Threshold (1904); and Deirdre (1907). His poetry collections include The Wanderings of Oisin (1889); The Celtic Twilight (1893); The Wind Among the Reeds (1899); The Wild Swans at Coole (1917); and The Tower (1928). Yeats was elected to a seat in the Irish Free Senate in 1922 and awarded the Nobel Prize in 1923. He died January 29, 1939, in Roquebrune, France. In 1948, his remains were re-interred in Drumcliff, Sligo. He is widely considered one of the greatest poets of the twentieth century.
I will arise and go now, and go to Innisfree,
And a small cabin build there, of clay and wattles
made:
Nine bean-rows I will have there, a hive for the
honey-bee,
And live alone in the bee-loud glade. 5
And I shall have some peace there, for peace
comes dropping slow,
Dropping from the veils of the morning to where
the cricket sings;
There midnight’s all a glimmer, and noon a purple
glow,
And evening full of the linnet’s wings.
I will arise and go now, for always night and day.
I hear lake water lapping with low sounds by the 10
shore;
While I stand on the roadway, or on the pavements
grey,
I hear it in the deep heart’s core.
In this line Yeats establishes the opening tone as well as the refrain of the poem. The poem focuses on Innisfree as a place of escape for the speaker.
Here the speaker describes Innisfree as a simple, natural environment where he will build a cabin and live alone. Note the rich description in these lines. The language is specific. The speaker does not merely mention that he will build a cabin, but also that it will be made of “clay and wattles.” The speaker also specifies that he will have “nine bean-rows,” instead of simply a “garden.” These

are images that conjure up in the mind of the reader concrete visual features of Yeats’s poetic fantasy. Notice also the particularly interesting image of the “bee-loud glade.” This image invests Innisfree with a magical air.
In these lines Yeats introduces the connection between peace and Innisfree in the speaker’s mind. The first line of the second stanza repeats the same meter employed in the first line of the first stanza. The reader can sense a refrain developing. The line “And I shall have some peace there, for peace comes dropping slow” is composed almost entirely of iambic feet. This means that one unaccented syllable is followed by an accented syllable. The iambs are interrupted in the middle of the line by an amphibrach with the phrase “some peace there.” An amphibrach is composed of two unaccented syllables sandwiching an accented one. It is used for emphasis. The amphibraic foot in the fifth line corresponds with the similar foot in the first line. This may be used to emphasize the metaphor that Innisfree represents escape for the speaker. Line six contains a good example of figurative language. Yeats wants to explain that the abstract idea of “peace” is abundant from morning until night in Innisfree, but instead of relying on that cliche, he transforms morning into the image of veils from which peace falls. Night has also been transformed into “where the cricket sings.”
Here Yeats continues with transforming midnight and noon into almost eerie images. Evening becomes a dark image of the sky filled with the wings of birds.
In the last lines of the poem, the speaker stands in the street surrounded by gray pavement. This image, which is hard and silent, contrasts with the soothing, soft image of the water. The speaker continues to hear the sounds of nature even in the city. The peace of Innisfree is able to transcend the urban environment because it resides in a completely natural one, that of the speaker himself.
“The Lake Isle of Innisfree” expresses the idea that nature provides an inherently restorative place to which human beings can go to escape the chaos and corrupting influences of civilization. In his autobiography, Yeats writes that his poem was influenced by his reading of American writer Henry David Thoreau ’s Walden (1854), which describes Thoreau’s experiment of living alone in a small hut in the woods on Walden Pond, outside Concord, Massachusetts. Thoreau lived in his one-room house from 1845–1847, gardening, writing, and studying natural history. Thoreau championed the solitary, self-sufficient life lived in harmony with nature, considering it more authentic than a life spent balancing ledgers or working for someone else. He disdained the ways working for a living and acquiring material goods can control one’s life. Explaining his motivation for the experiment, Thoreau writes in Walden :
I went to the woods because I wished to live deliberately, to front only the essential facts of life, and see if I could not learn what it had to teach, and not, when I came to die, discover that I had not lived. I did not wish to live what was not life, living is so dear; nor did I wish to practise resignation, unless it was quite necessary.
Yeats also expresses this sentiment when he writes of building a small cabin “of clay and wattles” and living alone “in the bee-loud glade” of Innisfree. Yeats seems to refer to Walden when he writes of the “Nine bean-rows I will have there,” and he underscores the contrast between rural and urban lifestyle in the last lines, when he places himself “on the roadway, or on the pavements grey.” Both of these images symbolize the destructive, joy-deadening forces of modern life. Yeats emphasizes the authenticity of the desire to live close to nature, writing that he hears the call to go to Innisfree “in the heart’s deep core.”
A primary feature of Romantic poetry is the idea of the imagination as a faculty that can generate alternate realities. The speaker of “The Lake Isle of Innisfree” exercises this faculty by daydreaming about life in the country. The entire poem describes a life that he “will” live, not one he is currently living. The detail of his fantasy suggests that the speaker has entertained this desire previously. Readers can clearly picture the haven the speaker imagines. He enumerates the bean-rows he will have, describes the building materials of his cabin, and lists particular creatures he will hear, i.e., bees, crickets, linnets.

verse, poets have used their imaginations to conjure worlds in which they would be more content and where their “true” selves could find peace. But for Yeats, this imagined world remained a fantasy: unlike Thoreau, Yeats never lived the rural life. Rather, he was an urban man of letters, an Irish senator, and a Nobel laureate. Moreover, his later poems never exhibited the degree or kind of romanticism shown in “The Lake Isle of Innisfree.”
Less than a hundred years before Yeats penned “The Lake Isle of Innisfree,” William Wordsworth wrote in a sonnet that “the world is too much with us,” meaning that the human mind and heart are too preoccupied by the material or worldly seductions of urban living. Yeats experienced the urge to return to a simpler, more familiar life as a kind of homesickness which expressed itself as a desire to “return” to Innisfree, a small island at the eastern end of Lough Gill in County Sligo. The poet regularly visited Sligo while growing up, and the inspiration for the poem came when Yeats was living in London and walking Fleet Street , a busy commercial section of the city. The sound of a fountain’s water reminded him of the Sligo lake, and the poem was born. Two other early poems by Yeats which deal with nostalgia and escape are “The Stolen Child” and “To an Isle in the Water.”
“The Lake Isle of Innisfree” is written with an abab rhyme scheme corresponding to each of the three quatrains in the poem, which are defined as a stanza composed of four lines which may or may not have a set line length. Also prevalent is the use of alliteration and assonance, both of which emphasize the musical tone and rhythm of the piece.
When a stanza in a poem has a pattern of rhymes it is called a “rhyme scheme.” “The Lake Isle of Innisfree” utilizes end rhyme in an abab rhyme scheme. This means that the end of the first line of a stanza rhymes with the end of the third line, and the end of the second line of a stanza rhymes with the end of the fourth line. All three of the quatrains in “The Lake Isle of Innisfree” display an abab rhyme scheme.
“The Lake Isle of Innisfree” uses “alliteration” and “assonance” to emphasize the sound and mood of the poem. Alliteration is the repetition of certain consonants in a poem which are often used in order to stress a word or phrase. Notice the sound of the consonants ‘l’ and ‘s’ in the following line:
“I hear lake water lapping with the low sounds by the shore.” Read the line aloud and notice the emphasis on the words “lapping,” “low,” and “shore.” Assonance occurs when the vowel sounds attached to different consonants are repeated in a poem. Notice the sound of the vowels ‘i’ and ‘o’ in the following line:
“I will arise and go now, and go to Innisfree.” Assonance is less clear than either rhyme or alliteration, but its use is similar. It links important words or phrases in the poem together.
In the 1880s, when Yeats wrote “The Lake Isle of Innisfree,” Ireland was in economic and political turmoil, and Yeats and his family were struggling financially. It is not surprising that the sound of a water fountain on a bustling London street would remind him of the lapping water of Lough Gill and stir the boyhood dream he had of living on Innisfree, unencumbered by the demands of modern urban life.
Ireland was an agricultural country in the nineteenth century, but British landlords controlled many farms. Farmers had fought for almost three centuries for greater say in their livelihood. In the 1880s, they finally achieved some success. The leader for Irish land reform and Home Rule (i.e., a subordinate parliament for Ireland) was Charles Steward Parnell (1846–1891), often referred to as the “uncrowned King of Ireland.” Parnell, a wealthy Protestant landlord who empathized with the plight of the Irish, was elected to Parliament in 1875 and became head of the Irish Party.
With the backing of Parnell, along with Catholic labor activist Michael Davitt (1846–1906), liberal British Prime Minister Gladstone enacted the Land Act of 1881, which guaranteed tenant farmers fair rent, protection against eviction, and the freedom to sell or transfer the lease on their farm. Parliament also passed a “franchise act,” adding some 500,000 new voters to the rolls, most of whom were middle-class and poor Catholics who supported Parnell. Still, a Home Rule Bill was defeated in Commons in 1886, and in 1890, Parnell was disgraced when a court revealed he had been “living in sin” with the wife of William Henry O’Shea, a politician and fellow member of the Irish Party.
A second Home Rule Bill was introduced in 1893 but also defeated, this time in the House of Lords . After this defeat, many Irish nationalists, such as Yeats, turned their attention to developing a greater sense of Ireland’s contributions to culture and the arts. For example, Douglas Hyde , who later became president of the Irish Free State , founded the Gaelic League in 1893. The League spearheaded

efforts to revive pride in Irish ethnic and national identity, supporting various initiatives to publicize Gaelic language and culture. The “Irish Ireland” movement also included organizations such as The Gaelic Athletic Association, formed to promote traditional Irish sports such as hurling and football.
Almost as soon as the Yeats family moved to London in 1887, Yeats became homesick. The new home, a dark squalid row house in a lower-middle-class neighborhood of Kensington, depressed the entire family, and Yeats often dreamt of returning to Ireland. However, Yeats finally found a measure of solace in the literary scene in London. Not more than a mile from the Yeats’s house lived William Morris , poet and father of the Arts and Crafts movement, whose large house and stables were a meeting ground for writers and artists. Morris befriended Yeats, and the poet wrote for Morris’s socialist magazine, Commonweal .
Yeats returned to Ireland in mid-August, 1887, and stayed there through the end of the year. During this time, he wrote his first major poem, “The Wanderings of Oisin,” crafted from Irish folklore. When Yeats returned to London in 1888, he deepened his associations with London’s writers, including Oscar Wilde and George Bernard Shaw . A few years later, along with Ernest Rhys, Yeats formed the Rhymers Club, founded to help young poets get their start. From this group, Yeats became involved with the Irish National Literary Society, whose members he sparred with on and off in the coming years. Yeats was also involved during this time with Madame Blavatsky’s Theosophical Society and later with the Hermetic Students of the Golden Dawn. Blavatsky was an occultist and major figure in England and Ireland in the late nineteenth century; her book, The Occult World , was wildly popular among artists and writers. Blavatsky held séances, practiced magic, and encouraged followers to pursue “union with the absolute.” Her emphasis on the spiritual aspects of existence resonated with Yeats’s own anti-materialist sentiments.
“The Lake Isle of Innisfree” is one of Yeats’s earlier poems and also one of his best known. It is perhaps so widely known due to its universal subject matter, that of the conflict between youth and aging, and the longing for emotional escape. Author William York Tindall, in his book W. B. Yeats , terms “The Lake Isle of Innisfree” “a vision of escape.” However, some find the poem overly sentimental and prefer Yeats’s later poems. F. R. Leavis, in his book New Bearings in English Poetry: A Study of the Contemporary Situation, cites a statement by Yeats regarding his early poetry:
I tried after the publication of The Wanderings of Oisin to write of nothing but emotion, and in the simplest language, and now I have had to go through it all, cutting out or altering passages that are sentimental from lack of thought.
Edmund Wilson , in his book Alex’s Castle: A Study in the Imaginative Literature of 1870-1930 , explores the conflict between Yeats’s world of imagination in his poetry and the world of reality:
The world of imagination is shown us in Yeats’s early poetry as something infinitely delightful, infinitely seductive, as something to which one becomes delirious and drunken—and as something which is somehow incompatible with, and fatal to, the good life of that actual world which is so full of weeping and from which it is so sweet to withdraw.
Semansky is an instructor of English literature and composition whose essays, poems, and stories regularly appear in journals and magazines. In this essay, Semansky considers the relationship between self-image and daydreaming in Yeats’s poem.
Yeats’s poem is perhaps most interesting for what it does not say. Although the speaker expresses the desire to arise and “go to Innisfree,” he never explicitly states what it is that motivates this desire. This absence asks readers to infer what compels the speaker to be other than where he is. People often daydream when they are dissatisfied with their lives. They fantasize about how circumstances might be different and how new surroundings would make them more content, perhaps even how such a change would make them different persons. They see themselves in daydreams differently than they see themselves in their “waking” life. By examining the speaker’s daydream closely, readers can deduce the speaker’s current situation and speculate about his inspiration for writing the poem.
The opening line of the poem, repeated as the first line in the last stanza, tells readers what the speaker “will” do: “I will arise and go now, and go to Innisfree.” Echoing the parable of the prodigal son in the New Testament (Luke: 15:18), which begins, “I will arise and go to my father,” Yeats, consciously or not, infuses his poem with religious weight. This choice suggests that the person Yeats would like to be is the one who returns home, fulfills his familial duties as a son, and yet nonetheless achieves his own separate identity as a poet. Yeats spent much of his youth in County Sligo, home to his mother’s family, but they were not particularly happy years. By picturing himself on Innisfree, an island on Lake Gill in Sligo, Yeats can, imaginatively, both return to the place of his childhood, effecting a kind of redemption, and yet remain separate from it.
In his biography of Yeats, Yeats: The Man and the Masks , Richard Ellmann notes that Yeats was in London when he wrote “The Lake Isle of Innisfree,” and that despite the robust literary scene there, felt shy and out of place. Ellmann writes, “To a poor Irishman. .. it seemed alien and hostile.. . . Yeats often dreamed of beating a retreat to Sligo.” Ellmann sees Yeats’s homesickness as an unbearable desire, writing that Yeats
filled his poems and stories with dim, pale things, and longed to return to an island like Innisfree, where his “old care will cease” because an island was neither mainland nor water but something of both, and because the return to Sligo, though he knew it now to be impossible, would be a return to the prepubertal stage when his consciousness had not yet been split in two.
Some critics go as far as seeing the poem as a kind of death wish. Henry Merritt, for example, in his essay, “Rising and Going: The ‘Nature’ of Yeats’s ‘The Lake Isle of Innisfree,’” argues that Sligo is closely linked with failure in Yeats’s imagination because it is home to Yeats’s maternal family, the Pollexfens of Sligo, who largely disliked the poet. A return to Sligo marked a surrender to the stodgy, provincial values of the Pollexfens, Merritt argues.
But Yeats never went to Innisfree; the poem remained at the level of a daydream, albeit one with specific benefits for the young poet. One of these is that he was able to grapple with the kind of person he was becoming by imagining the kind of person he might be. The imagery in the first stanza alludes to the life that Thoreau made for himself at Walden Pond. It is not only the kind of life that Thoreau lived, however, that Yeats is drawn to but also the kind of person Thoreau was. An American transcendentalist who championed civil liberties, Thoreau was known as much for his politics as he was for his nature writing. Yeats’s fantasy of living in a Walden-like hut, in Walden-like surroundings, then, is also a fantasy of being the kind of person who could bring about such a dream— strong, self-reliant, full of conviction and initiative. It is significant that Yeats wrote the poem in his early twenties, a time when most people are still struggling to carve out a place for themselves in the world.
In The Interpretation of Dreams , Freud claims that the purpose of creative writing is to fulfill both the author’s fantasies and the reader’s. Poets and fiction writers—those who traffic in fantasies, daydreams, and the world of the imagination—perform a kind of regulatory function for society, in that they give voice to fantasies that readers sometimes do not even know they have. “The Lake Isle of Innisfree” remains one of Yeats’s most popular poems because of this very fact. Readers vicariously participate in Yeat’s fantasy because it is such a popular and generic one. Although not everyone necessarily desires to live alone in a small cabin, the wish to live close to nature and away from the distractions of modern life is common, as is the wish to see one’s own self in the best possible light. Compared to Yeats’s later more modern poetry, the poem is sentimental and conventional, but these facts have also helped its popularity, as those very features make “The Lake Isle of Innisfree” accessible to more readers, meeting their expectations of what poetry should do.
Yeats moves from simply wishing he were elsewhere to coming up with a concrete plan for being there. The details in the first stanza read as a kind of blueprint for his Eden-like cabin. He imagines himself as a steward of the land and all the life on it. The second stanza, however, paints a more impressionistic scene. In addition to the cabin and “bee-loud glade,” the speaker will also find peace, “Dropping from the veils of the morning to where the cricket sings.” Such emphasis on quiet and solitude tells readers something about what the speaker’s current life must be like: crowded, hectic, noisy. Living alone on an island in the midst of a lake is about as far away from those circumstances as possible. The imagery and figurative language of the second stanza also underscore the dreamy nature of the speaker’s fantasy, highlighting the distinction between the real and the imaginary, the present and the future, the city and the country.
Sights, sounds, touches, smells are often catalysts for memories, and the sound of fountain water on a busy London street has evoked the memory of Yeats’s childhood for him. The consuming nature of the speaker’s desire to leave his present situation and return to the setting of his childhood is evident in the last stanza, when he says, “for always
“Although not everyone necessarily desires to live in a small cabin, the wish to live close to nature and away from the distractions of modern life is common, as is the wish to see one’s own self in thebest possible light.”
night and day / I hear lake water lapping with low sounds by the shore.” Such an aural hallucination underscores the intensity of Yeats’s memory of Lake Gill and what that memory now represents for him. It is significant that in his autobiography Yeats says the poem is the first he had written with anything of his “own music” in it, for it represents a maturing, both poetically and emotionally, of the poet’s relationship to his past and his own self image.

In the following essay, Hunter examines what Innisfree symbolizes to Yeats as a poet.
In an attempt to explain the nature of the attraction he feels toward the Devon farm he calls Thorn-combe, the protagonist of John Fowles ’ Daniel Martin refers to a passage in Restif de la Bretonne’s eighteenth-century romanced autobiography, Monsieur Nicholas , in which the speaker describes the feeling of total peace and joy found in a remote, lush, hidden valley in the Burgundian hills. Fowles’ protagonist, after pointing out that the Frenchman “baptized the place simply la bonne vaux : the valley of abundance, the sacred combe,” goes on to describe the general nature of such places as “outside the normal world, intensely private and enclosed, intensely green and fertile, numinous, haunted and haunting, dominated by a sense of magic that is also a sense of a mysterious yet profound parity in all existence.” In the context of Fowles’ novel, this section serves to illustrate

both the necessity for the artist to find a place of retreat and the fact that such places exist for him, as an artist and human being, not simply as geographic locations but also, and more importantly, as symbolic settings. La bonne vaux , while a physical place, is more importantly a state of mind in which the individual is linked by the significant details of his surrounding to a symbolic world that stretches beyond the boundaries of human time and space. In his description of the lake isle of Innisfree, W. B. Yeats presents his version of la bonne vaux , an ostensibly nostalgic description of a specific geographic location that, through the particular physical details and the symbolic force of those details, is transformed into a symbolic landscape. Like Daniel Martin’s Thorncombe and Monsieur Nicholas’ bonne vaux , Yeats’ lake isle is private and enclosed, in this case by the waters of Lough Gill. It is fertile, as the beans and bees clearly indicate. It is numinous, in that it is both a physical island and a state of mind created by that island. It is haunted by the mythical Tuatha da Danaan and is haunting to the speaker of the poem, as the last stanza clearly reveals. In fact, Yeat’s view of the island in his youth was dominated by the magical and mysterious story about the Tuatha da Danaan and the Danaan Quicken tree:
I planned to live some day in a cottage on a little island called Innisfree. .. I should live, as Thoreau lived, seeking wisdom. There was a story in the county history of a tree that had once grown upon that island guarded by some terrible monster and borne the food of the gods. A young girl pined for the fruit and told her lover to kill the monster and carry the fruit away. He did as he had been told, but tasted the fruit; and when he reached the mainland where she had waited for him, was dying of its powerful virtue. And from sorrow and from remorse she too ate of it and died. I do not remember whether I chose the island [as the proposed place of retreat] because of its beauty or for the story’s sake, but I was twenty-two or three before I gave up the dream.
Yeats’ attitude to the lake isle of Innisfree, then, is markedly similar to the attitude described by Fowles’ narrator in Daniel Martin . The importance of Yeats’ poem “The Lake Isle of Innisfree,” a work often dismissed as a youthful, nostalgic, derivatively romantic lyric, lies in the very qualities that make the physical setting numinous for the author as young artist. Through a careful examination of the precise details and specific symbolism of the poem, one comes to see that, for the young Yeats, the retreat to the island of Innisfree is a journey in search of poetic wisdom and spiritual peace, a journey prompted by supernatural urgings, a journey in quest of identity within a tradition. The wisdom and peace that are the goal of the quest can only be realized through a poetic and spiritual grasp of the parity and even identity that exists between the legendary past of the Celtic world and the present, and of the presence of that past in the mind and spirit of the artist attuned to the numinous qualities of his particular bonne vaux .
Of the genesis of the poem and of its relationship to Yeats’ development as a poet we know a great deal. By the time the poem began to take shape, some time late in 1888, the young poet had already published Poems and Ballads of Young Ireland (Dublin, 1888), and Fairy and Folk Tales of the Irish
“... for the young Yeats, the retreat to the island of Innisfree is a journey in search of poetic wisdom and spiritual peace, a journey prompted by supernatural urgings, a journey in quest of identity within a tradition”.
Peasantry (Dublin, 1888), and was about to publish his first major volume of verse based on the Irish legends he had heard and learned during his frequent visits with his mother’s parents in Sligo, The Wanderings of Oisin and other Poems (London, 1889). Although his thorough involvement in the Celtic Renaissance would not bear significant poetic fruit until the latter part of the 1890s, it is clear from the poems written in the early part of the decade, and indeed in the latter 1880s, that Yeats was fully aware of the poetic potential of the Celtic legends of Ireland and of his relationship, as poet, to the Celtic tradition. The specific background of “The Lake Isle of Innisfree” is made clear for us both by the commentaries of Jeffares and Alspach and by Yeats’ own autobiographical comments. His familiarity with the connection between the Tuatha da Danaan and the island of Innisfree is clear from the passage from the Autobiographies cited above. Yeats had gleaned the legend of the Danaan Quicken tree from William Gregory Wood-Martin’s History of Sligo (1882) and seems to have used the idea of a plant or tree sacred to the Celtic gods not only as the basis for the poem “The Danaan Quicken Tree” but also, with some transformation, in the bean rows of the poem under examination here. The early version of the poem, sent to Katharine Tynan in 1888, contains the text of the first two stanzas, including the details of the dwelling of clay and wattles, the bee hives and bean rows, and mention of the sounds and colours of the island. It lacks, however, the final stanza, the stanza that pulls the poem together and gives it its specific context and direction. Yeats tells us about the genesis of the final stanza—if not the entire poem—in the Autobiographies:
I had still the ambition, formed in Sligo in my teens, of living in imitation of Thoreau on Innisfree, a little island in Lough Gill, and when walking through Fleet Street very homesick I heard a little tinkle of water and saw a fountain in a shop-window which balanced a little ball upon its jet, and began to remember lake water. From the sudden remembrance came my poem “Innisfree,” my first lyric with anything in its rhythm of my own music.
The first printed version of the work appeared in The National Observer for 13 December, 1890, and the poem was then reprinted in The Book of the Rhymers’ Club (London, 1892), and The Countess Kathleen and Various Legends and Lyrics (London, 1892), without substantive changes. Yeats then included the poem in more than twenty collections of his works published between 1892 and the time of his death, again without substantive changes. Given that Yeats was constantly—and not always productively—revising his early work, it is significant that this poem was left virtually untouched through almost fifty years in which it could have been altered. This lack of tampering or revising seems to argue for its being one of the few early poems that Yeats considered to have achieved, in his eyes, its perfect expression at an early point in his poetic development. It is also significant to note that, with the exception of its inclusion in the first two collections, it does not appear in any of the works that Yeats organized around a particular thematic principle. Rather, it stands as a single, isolated work, a world unto itself, which seems to argue for its being considered a central statement in his poetic development. Interesting though the genesis and printing history of the poem might be, however, it is in the content of the poem, in the rich symbolic and mythic matrices for the work, that its major importance lies.
Stylistically speaking, the poem is not remarkable. It clearly shows, in its fascination with detail, the influence of the Pre-Raphaelitism of the Rhymers’ Club, and also demonstrates, in its succession of three fairly regular quatrains, the influence of the lyrics of the Romantics. The first stanza, after describing the basic motivation of the speaker, goes on to give details of the habitation he will build in his retreat. The second stanza then details the benefits that he will derive from his solitary existence. The final stanza then adds urgency by contrasting the images of the rural retreat with the bustle of urban life, thereby strengthening the motivation behind the resolution expressed in the first line. In form, then, the poem is a simple nostalgic lyric expressing the speaker’s desire to find a kind of peace in a place of rural solitude he has known in his youth. Aside from some minor metrical effects, there is nothing in the form and structure of the poem to indicate a departure from tradition in the work. The music of which Yeats speaks in the Autobiographies is heard not through the form of the poem but rather through the symbolic dimensions of the imagery, and one of those dimensions is seen in the role of the speaker. The speaker in the poem is presented as a seeker or questor. The initial line, with its ironic echo of the prodigal son ’s resolution, strengthens this notion, as does the double mention of the roadway in line 11. The actual location described in the first two stanzas of the poem, both in terms of the times mentioned and the specific details of geographical location, strengthens the idea that the speaker is seeking something more than a place in which to relax. The particular physical details that are provided in the first two stanzas describe not only an actual place but also a state of mind achieved because of the place. The description of time in the second stanza, with its double mention of evening and midnight, also stresses that the place is one in which mental and not physical vision is the important factor. The poem is presented, furthermore, through a first-person speaker. The air of immediacy created through the use of this kind of narrative voice amplifies the subjectivity of the utterance and stresses the importance of the dream or vision to the speaker himself. The retreat to Innisfree will be a solitary retreat; but it will be one that links the speaker, through the visions described, with his natural and, from what we know about the mythic significance of the island, supernatural world. The simplicity of rhetorical devices in the poem has, at once, a charm and yet an archaic air. The simplicity serves to stress the romantic nostalgia of the poem, but the deliberate archaisms—archaisms that, although he later repudiated them, Yeats did not choose to change—link the poem to the past, to the traditions of a day gone by and yet still present in the setting described. It is in the imagery and the allusions of the poem, though, more than in the type of speaker, choice of verse form, or particular rhetorical techniques, that Yeats makes his strongest statement, a statement that links the subjective speaker of the poem to a tradition that, because it stretches back to the Celtic vision both of the significance of the lake isle of Innisfree and of the role of the poet/hermit, objectifies the experience at the core of the work.
One of the central allusions in the poem, however, seems initially to have little to do with the Celtic. In describing the crops of the island, Yeats specifically mentions two things: honey and beans. Although the latter may seem out of place, when one remembers the two passages in the Autobiographies that refer directly to the poem, one notes that, in both cases, Yeats mentions Thoreau, the bean-cultivating hermit of Walden pond. Yeats’ youthful desire was to live “in imitation of Thoreau on Innisfree”, “to live, as Thoreau did, seeking wisdom.” Thoreau tells us that, when he went to Walden Pond, he was “determined to know beans.” As Thoreau’s editor points out, “A common expression in New England is ‘He doesn’t know beans,’ meaning the person is ignorant.” To put it another way, to know beans is to be wise. Hence one can see that it is possible for Yeats to have equated, tropologically, Thoreau’s cultivation of beans with his pursuit of wisdom. In speaking of Walden Pond, Thoreau comments on the memories he has of a childhood visit there, of his awareness of those who dwelt there in the past, of his awareness of the birds and animals there, of the fact that gardening has long been a venerated occupation of intelligent men, and of the connection between gardening and ritual, of the connection between farming and the making of a better mankind. Familiar with Thoreau’s work, the young Yeats was also familiar with the way in which Thoreau saw the retreat to a childhood-visited rural setting and the occupation of oneself in gardening as tropes for the poetic retreat in search of wisdom. In his nostalgic lyric description of Innisfree, Yeats carefully points out his awareness of the birds there, of the speaker’s occupation as a gardener, and of the peace that comes from such an occupation in such a place. To connect the retreat to Innisfree with Thoreau’s retreat to Walden in search of wisdom, Yeats carefully includes not only the mention of the honeybee, traditionally a symbol of industry, culture, and wisdom, but also the bean plant. Through this latter image, one sees a connection between Yeats’ retreat and Thoreau’s that places the former’s retreat into a particular symbolic context. Through the references to Thoreau in the Autobiographies , then, and through the image of the bean in the first stanza, one sees a close connection between the nature and objectives of the hermit of Walden Pond and the speaker in Yeats’ poem. Yet the context of the retreat to Innisfree is more specifically defined through the connections that the location has with particular aspects of Celtic folklore, another branch of the tree of knowledge with which Yeats was quite familiar.
Writing in The Speaker in 1893, Yeats remarked that “Folklore is at once the Bible, the Thirty-nine articles, and the Book of Common Prayer , as well nigh all the great poets have lived by its light, Homer, Aeschylus, Sophocles, Shakespeare, and even Dante, Goethe, and Keats, were little more than folk-lorists with musical tongues.” Yeats’ interest in folk-lore had already led him to publish Fairy and Folk Tales of the Irish Peasantry (London, 1888) and to use the material of Irish folk mythology as the basis of many of the selections in Poems and Ballads of Young Ireland (Dublin, 1888) and The Wanderings of Oisin and Other Poems (London, 1889). As Daniel Hoffman remarks in his recent study of Yeats, Graves, and Muir—three poets who developed from their awareness of folk-lore a particularly coherent and compelling personal mythology that links the individual to the tradition—:
Not only ballad tradition but folk beliefs in the supernatural and the body of myths and legends from the Irish Heroic Age contributed subjects to [Yeats’] poems and plays. His firsthand observation, when a youth, of the folklore beliefs in the West of Ireland comprised his initial experience of the spiritual reality denied by the deterministic philosophy of the day.. . Critics have little heeded Yeats’ tenacity in holding and remolding the folk beliefs with which he started out. Much though he remade his style and changed his attitudes toward life, he did not repudiate this first area of his experience and research. Instead he found ways to change his use of it to conform with the evolution of his art and of his thought.
Yeats’ awareness of folk belief is connected with his desire to retreat to Innisfree, as the Autobiographies show. After recounting the legend of the Danaan Quicken Tree, he remarks: “I do not remember whether I chose the island [of Innisfree for my retreat] because of its beauty or for the story’s sake …” Although the former may be sufficient reason in itself, the latter is more pressing in terms of the symbolism of the poem. The dominance of the Tuatha da Danaan in Yeats’ poetic imagination forms a link between the young poet, the folk mythologies, and the island of Innisfree that stretches throughout Yeats’ verse. The Tuatha da Danaan, as one folklorist points out, were early invaders of Ireland, closely schooled in the Druidic mysteries. Defeated by the Sons of Míl, they made a deal with the Gaels whereby the Gaels were left to control the upper or human world and the Tuatha da Danaan were left to rule the world under ground, from which world they controlled magic and led a life largely independent of human society. They are creatures of the ‘other world.’ “Theirs is an idealised, magic counterpart of the natural world into which mortal men rarely intrude except by invitation or by accident.” “The Hosting of the Sidhe,” the first poem in Yeats’ The Wind Among the Reeds (London, 1899), has a lengthy headnote in which Yeats gives a lengthy description of the Tuatha da Danaan, or “the Sidhe … the people of the Faery Hills.” In that head-note Yeats comments, in a passage that deals with the contact between the human world and the world of the Tuatha da Danaan, that “If any one becomes too much interested in them [the people of the Sidhe, the Tuatha da Danaan], and sees them over much, he loses all interest in ordinary things. I shall write a great deal elsewhere about such enchanted persons …” As we shall see in a moment, the speaker in “The Lake Isle of Innisfree” may very well be one of those “enchanted persons,” but to grasp the full significance of the enchantment and its connection with the artist’s pursuit of wisdom and peace, we must look further into the origins of the Tuatha da Danaan.
Robert Graves remarks in The White Goddess , that “According to legend, the Danaans had come to Britain [and to Ireland] from Greece by way of Denmark to which they had given the name of their goddess…” At another point in his discussion of their origins, Graves describes the Tuatha da Danaan as “ Bronze Age Pelasgians expelled from Greece in the middle of the second millenium…” He further identifies Danu, their goddess, with the pre-Achean goddess Danaë of Argos, a figure he sees as one of the many embodiments of the White Goddess. Yeats remarks, when speaking of Danu and her followers, that “The old Gaelic literature is full of appeals of the Tribes of the goddess Danu to … mortals whom they would bring into their country …” It would appear, then, that the Tuatha da Danaan exist as a tribe of fairy people intimately connected with the legendary history of Ireland, who still inhabit the land, and who are interested, from time to time, in luring those mortals interested in them into their enchanted faery otherworld. The enchantment that the speaker in “The Lake Isle of Innisfree” feels may indeed be seen as a form in that lure. Yeats says in the Autobiographies that he recalled Innisfree when he heard the water in the fountain. The speaker in the poem, on the other hand, hears the insistent lapping sound of lake water, a sound that is closely connected with the Tuatha da Danaan:
To this day the Tribes of the goddess Danu that are in the waters beckon to men … The people of the waters have been in all ages beautiful and changeable and lascivious, or beautiful and wise and lonely, for water is everywhere the signature of the fruitfulness of the body and of the fruitfulness of dreams.
The call felt by the speaker in “The Lake Isle of Innisfree” may indeed, given the symbolic contexts of the poem, by a call from the fairy people to whom Innisfree was once a holy place, because of the Danaan Quicken tree. In his headnote to the discarded poem “The Danaan Quicken Tree”, a poem published originally in The Bookman in 1893, Yeats mentions the tree that he speaks of at greater length in his recounting of the legend of the tree in the Autobiographies . Yeats’ knowledge of Irish folklore in general, then, and his particular awareness of the connection between the Tuatha da Danaan and the lake isle of Innisfree, would argue for a close connection in his mind between the luring habits of the Tuatha da Danaan and the island itself. The peace that comes to the person who inhabits the island, then, is a peace that derives from a poetic, a spiritual grasp of the tradition and the traditional powers of the ancient fairy people to whom the island was once a sacred spot. The vegetation of the island, furthermore, is of particular importance to its sacred nature. The retreat to the lake isle of Innisfree, then, is not only a poetic retreat in pursuit of wisdom but also a retreat in search of and possibly in response to the urgings of the goddess Danu. The direct link between wisdom, Innisfree, and the Tuatha da Danaan becomes quite clear when one examines closely the detailed description that the poet provides of the habitation his speaker will build there and of the particular horticultural pursuits in which he will engage.
In the first stanza of the poem, the speaker argues that he will build himself a small cabin out of clay and wattles in a setting that has echoes of Eden, of Thoreau’s hermitage at Walden Pond, and of the sacred combe of Restif de la Bretonne’s Monsieur Nicholas . In the description of the building materials to be used for the cabin one sees not just the traditional building materials of the rural peasant but also a connection between the world of man and the world of the Tuatha da Danaan. The cabin is to be built of clay and wattles. Clay, being a material linked symbolically with man, needs no explication. The wattles, on the other hand, carry with them a symbolic association that links them with Celtic mythology and specifically with the Aes Sidhe , the Tuatha da Danaan. It was the people of the sidhe who were responsible for building the circular hill forts known as raths or Dane Raths, the basic component of which structures was wattles from the hazel tree. Robert Graves points out that, in Celtic mythology, “the hazel was the Bile Ratha , ‘the venerated tree of the rath’—the rath in which the poetic Aes Sidhe lived”. He also indicates, though, that “with the ancient Irish the tree of eloquence and wisdom was the hazel.” Hence it appears that the type of cabin that Yeats’ speaker plans to build is closely linked both to the “poetic Aes Sidhe ” and to the matters of eloquence and wisdom. Yeats’ choice of particular detail in this case directs the reader to a specific connection between the apparently simple descriptive surface and the actual symbolic depth of the poem. The connection between the Aes Sidhe and the speaker in “The Lake Isle of Innisfree” is further elaborated when one considers the horticultural aspect of the Innisfree garden or grove. The “hive for the honeybee” draws in the traditional symbolism of the bee as a figure associated with sweetness and light, with culture and wisdom; but the key reference in the third line is to the “Nine bean-rows.”
Critics have puzzled for some time over the precision of detail in this reference and over the particular significance both of the number used and the bean itself. One critic explains the precise detail in terms of Yeats’ stylistic affinities at the time the poem was written:
Another poem of Yeats which seems to imitate a Pre-Raphaelite painting is ‘She Dwelt among the Sycamores,’ … Here it is the insistence upon ‘precision’ of coloring and number, and upon a microscopic focus in general which marks the tell-tale Pre-Raphaelite objective of ‘truth to nature.’ The single ‘ash-grey feather’; the ‘six feet / lapped in the lemon daffodils’; the ‘four eyes’—all these represent the practice of artistic principles which began with the seven stars of the Blessed Damozel’s crown and reached as far as the ‘nine bean rows’ of the Lake Isle.
Though Eddins may be correct about the stylistic source of the precision in the lines, he does not answer the question about the reasons for Yeats’ choice of the plant or the number of rows. Alspach suggests a reason in a somewhat facetious fashion when he states that “one clever Yeats Freudian-critic has said of the nine bean-rows of the third line of ‘The Lake Isle of Innisfree’: that undoubtedly they symbolize the nine months of pregnancy.” A deeper searching of the Celtic mythology that plays such a large part in Yeats’ poetry reveals a much more plausable reason for the use both of the bean and of the number nine. The number can be explained by examining further the reference to the wattles of the cabin. The number nine, Graves remarks, is “traditionally associated with Coll, the hazel, the tree of Wisdom …” He further comments that “The letter Coll was used as the Bardic numeral nine—because nine is the number sacred to the Muses and because the hazel fruits after nine years.” He also points out the close connection in Celtic mythology between the hazel tree, the number nine, and poetic wisdom:
The ninth tree is the hazel, in the nutting season. The nut in Celtic legend is always an emblem of concentrated wisdom: something sweet, compact and sustaining enclosed in a small hard shell. .. The Rennes Dinnshechas . .. describes a beautiful fountain called Connla’s Well, near Tipperary, over which hung the nine hazels of poetic art which produced flowers and fruit (i.e. beauty and wisdom) simultaneously. As the nuts dropped into the well they fed the salmon swimming in it, and whatever number of nuts any of them swallowed, so many bright spots appeared on its body. All the knowledge of the arts and sciences was bound up with the eating of these nuts.
In the poem Yeats has specified the number nine and has already mentioned the “wattles” for which the hazel has been traditionally prized. Since Innisfree was the place on which grew the Danaan Quicken tree, whose fruit was ‘able to endow [mortals] with more than mortal powers”, since Yeats himself states that the wisdom provided by the Tuatha da Danaan is “the wisdom of the fools of Celtic stories, that is above all the wisdom of the wise”, and since the hazel nut is connected with wisdom, it is logical to assume that Yeats’ choice of the number nine is a reflection of his awareness of its connection with the numerology of Celtic mythology in general and its connection with wisdom in particular. This argument is supported by Yeats’ use of the bean as well. Yeats’ speaker does not plant or cultivate hazel trees, but bean rows. Yet the bean, as was mentioned earlier in connection with Thoreau, is also associated with wisdom: to know beans is to be wise. In this context, it would seem that the bean, like the hazel nut something “compact and sustaining” enclosed in a seed pod, is being used as a tropological analogue for the hazel nut. When one realizes that the bean is, as well, connected with poetic wisdom and with magic, the argument gains greater force. The bean has traditionally been associated with magic and with the supernatural: “Pliny in his Natural History records the belief that the souls of the dead reside in beans. According to the Scottish poet Montgomerie (1605), witches rode on bean stalks to their sabbaths.” The bean is also as Graves further suggests, scared to the White Goddess and therefore associated with poetic wisdom. From this group of folk-lore connections, it would appear that the reason for the choice of the particular detail in the third line of the poem lies in the associations made with the numerological significance of the number nine—both in classical and Celtic mythology—and with the relationship between beans and poetic wisdom on the one hand and the hazel nut and poetic wisdom on the other. The “peace” that comes “dropping slow”, then, is the peace that comes from the wisdom gained from the bean rows. In the Autobiographies Yeats argues that he dreamt of returning to Innisfree to “live, as Thoreau lived, seeking wisdom.” In the poem under examination here the particular nature of the wisdom sought is clarified when one examines the symbolic and mythological connections and allusions of the first stanza of the poem and realizes that the wisdom that is gained in the “bee-loud glade” is a spiritual wisdom, a wisdom “above all the wisdom of the wise”, a wisdom of a poetic character that is gained through an association with the magic and the mystery surrounding the Tuatha da Danaan and the poet who answers the call of the fairy people.
Whereas the first stanza of the poem establishes the general nature of the bonne vaux or sacred combe, the second stanza delineates the benefits derived therefrom. The peace that descends on the speaker in the second stanza is not described in explicit detail, but the colouring and tonality of the stanza, as well as the presence of the linnet, suggest that it is more than a sense of physical relaxation. On a superficial level the imagery of the stanza suggests a quiet rural Irish scene, complete with linnets at evening, mist in the morning, and particular colourations in the skies. The presence of the linnet, however, suggests that the peace achieved is more than physical repose. The linnet occurs in only one other poem by Yeats, “A Prayer for my Daughter,” written some thirty years after the composition of “The Lake Isle of Innisfree.” In the “Prayer” the linnet functions as a symbol for the purity and sweetness Yeats hopes will be his daughter’s lot:
May she become a flourishing hidden tree
That all her thoughts may like the linnet be,
And have no business but dispensing round
Their magnanimities of sound …
The linnet, like the bees in the first stanza of “The Lake Isle of Innisfree,” is connected with sweetness and beauty. In the second stanza, it is the sound and the sight of the linnet’s wings that attracts the speaker, and in this case suggests an analogy of a spiritual nature, drawing on the traditional association of birds with the soul. This would suggest that the peace achieved through intercourse with the Aes Sidhe is a peace that transcends the merely physical and stands sharply in contrast with the urban, mundane images of the final stanza of the poem.
In the final stanza we are returned from the speaker’s world of reverie to the world of reality. The resolution of the poem’s first line is reiterated, but this time with an insistence not present in the somewhat nostalgic initial statement. Instead we find that now the motivation to return to Innisfree is there “Always night and day” because of the sound of lake water. “To this day the Tribes of the goddess Danu that are in the waters beckon to men …” Yet the beckoning comes not to the physical ear; instead it is heard by “the deep heart’s core.” The sound that lures the speaker back to Innisfree is less a sound that is audible to the physical ear than a prompting to the ear of the spirit. The speaker is drawn back to Innisfree by the fairy magic of the tribes of the goddess Danu. In the choice of words and the use of images in the final stanza, Yeats skillfully makes explicit a contrast both between the rural and the urban and between the physical and the spiritual that has been implicit in the first two stanzas. In reading the final stanza the reader comes to see the noumenal nature of Innisfree.
Through an examination of the precise detail and specific symbolism of “The Lake Isle of Innisfree” the reader can come to see that, for Yeats, this small island in Lough Gill, just “opposite Slish Wood”, is more than just a physical place and that the desire to return to that spot is more than simply the homesick reaction of a young man far from his native soil. When one stops seeing the speaker as the author, when one stops viewing the poem simply as a nostalgic lyric, when one looks instead at the poem as an expression of the nature of the artist and his relationship to both the physical and symbolic aspects of his nature, land, and tradition, one begins to see that the lake isle of Innisfree is more than a place; like Byzantium, Innisfree is a state of being. Like Daniel Martin’s Thorncombe, like the Burgundian valley of Monsieur Nicholas , Innisfree is another bonne vaux , a valley of abundance, a sacred combe. In that it is an island, and in that it is enchanted, it is beyond the normal world. As an island it is surrounded by the wall of water, and as a magic place it is enclosed by its superstitions. Green and fertile, it clearly is both a physical garden and a garden or nursery of the spirit. As the former site of the Danaan Quicken tree, it is haunted by the children of the goddess Danu and still exercises its haunting power on those few who will listen through the sound of the lake waters that lap its shores. It is thereby dominated not only by a sense of nostalgia but also by a sense of the magical and mysterious way in which the Aes Sidhe , through the wattles of the dwelling, through the nine bean rows, through the power that the Celtic tradition displays, still influence the life of man. For Yeats, the speaker’s return to Innisfree is a journey in search of poetic wisdom and spiritual peace, a wisdom and peace that can be realized through a poetic and spiritual grasp of the parity that exists between the legendary past of Ireland and the present day, between the tradition and the mind that the spirit of the poet who is attuned to the numinous qualities of la bonne vaux .

The fundamental transformation in this reaction is a dimerization of an aldehyde (or ketone) to a beta-hydroxy aldehyde (or ketone) by alpha C–H addition of one reactant molecule to the carbonyl group of a second reactant molecule. Due to the carbanion like nature of enolates they can add to carbonyls in a similar manner as Grignard reagents. For this reaction to occur at least one of the reactants must have alpha hydrogens.
The aldol reactions for acetaldehyde and acetone are shown as examples.
Example: Aldol Reactions
Step 1: Enolate formation
Step 2: Nucleophilic reaction by the enolate
Step 3: Protonation
The products of aldol reactions often undergo a subsequent elimination of water, made up of an alpha-hydrogen and the beta-hydroxyl group. The product of this
-elimination reaction is an α,β-unsaturated aldehyde or ketone. Base-catalyzed elimination occurs with heating. The additional stability provided by the conjugated carbonyl system of the product makes some aldol reactions thermodynamically driven and mixtures of stereoisomers ( E & Z ) are obtained from some reactions. Reactions in which a larger molecule is formed from smaller components, with the elimination of a very small by-product such as water, are termed Condensations . Hence, the following examples are properly referred to as aldol condensations . Overall the general reaction involves a dehydration of an aldol product to form an alkene:
Going from reactants to products simply
Example: Aldol Condensation from an Aldol Reaction Product
1) Form enolate
2) Form enone
Under acidic conditions an enol is formed and the hydroxy group is protonated. Water is expelled by either and E1 or E2 reaction.
When performing both reactions together always consider the aldol product first then convert to the enone. Note! The double bond always forms in conjugation with the carbonyl.
Example: Aldol Condensation Directly from the Ketones or Aldehydes
Aldol reactions are excellent methods for the synthesis of many enones or beta hydroxy carbonyls. Because of this, being able to predict when an aldol reaction might be used in a synthesis in an important skill. This accomplished by mentally breaking apart the target molecule and then considering what the starting materials might be.
Fragments which are easily made by an aldol reaction
Steps to 'reverse' the aldol reaction (from the final aldol product towards identifying the starting compounds).
1) From an enone break the double bond and form two single bonds. Place and OH on the bond furthest from the carbonyl and an H on the bond closest to the carbonyl.
2) From the aldol product break the C-C bond between the alpha carbon and the carbon attached to the OH. Then turn the OH into a carbonyl and add an hydrogen to the other carbon.
Example: Determining the Reactant when given the Aldol Condensation Product
What reactant must be used to make the following molecule using an aldol condensation?
Solution
The previous examples of aldol reactions and condensations used a common reactant as both the enolic donor and the electrophilic acceptor. The product in such cases is always a dimer of the reactant carbonyl compound. Aldol condensations between different carbonyl reactants are called crossed or mixed reactions, and under certain conditions such crossed aldol condensations can be effective.
Example: Mixed Aldol Reaction (One Product)
The success of these mixed aldol reactions is due to two factors. First, aldehydes are more reactive acceptor electrophiles than ketones, and formaldehyde is more reactive than other aldehydes. Second, aldehydes lacking alpha-hydrogens can only function as acceptor reactants, and this reduces the number of possible products by half. Mixed aldols in which both reactants can serve as donors and acceptors generally give complex mixtures of both dimeric (homo) aldols and crossed aldols. Because of this most mixed aldol reactions are usually not performed unless one reactant has no alpha hydrogens.
The following abbreviated formulas illustrate the possible products in such a case, red letters representing the acceptor component and blue the donor. If all the reactions occurred at the same rate, equal quantities of the four products would be obtained. Separation and purification of the components of such a mixture would be difficult.
A CH 2 CHO + B CH 2 CHO + NaOH
A – A + B – B + A – B + B – A
Example: Products of a Mixed Aldol Reaction
The aldol condensation of ketones with aryl aldehydes to form α,β-unsaturated derivatives is called the Claisen-Schmidt reaction.
Example: Claisen-Schmidt Reaction
Molecules which contain two carbonyl functionalities have the possibility of forming a ring through an intramolecular aldol reaction. In most cases two sets of
hydrogens need to be considered. As with most ring forming reaction five and six membered rings are preferred (less ring strain).
As with other aldol reaction the addition of heat causes an aldol condensation to occur.

In 1839, Britain invaded China to crush opposition to its interference in the country’s economic, social, and political affairs. One of Britain’s first acts of the war was to occupy Hong Kong, a sparsely inhabited island off the coast of southeast China. In 1841, China ceded the island to the British with the signing of the Convention of Chuenpi, and in 1842 the Treaty of Nanking was signed, formally ending the First Opium War.
Britain’s new colony flourished as an East-West trading center and as the commercial gateway and distribution center for southern China. In 1898, Britain was granted an additional 99 years of rule over Hong Kong under the Second Convention of Peking. In September 1984, after years of negotiations, the British and the Chinese signed a formal agreement approving the 1997 turnover of the island in exchange for a Chinese pledge to preserve Hong Kong’s capitalist system. On July 1, 1997, Hong Kong was peaceably handed over to China in a ceremony attended by numerous Chinese, British, and international dignitaries. The chief executive under the new Hong Kong government, Tung Chee Hwa, formulated a policy based on the concept of “one country, two systems,” thus preserving Hong Kong’s role as a principal capitalist center in Asia.

Sometimes good character actors are just as memorable as the most prominent leading stars. That was certainly the case for Burt Mustin, who is recognizable for appearing in some of the most beloved sitcoms of all time. Whether you remember him from his days as Gus the Fireman on Leave It to Beaver or Jud Fletcher on The Andy Griffith Show , chances are you know Burt Mustin's face. One of the most interesting things about him though isn't his lengthy resume of TV shows he appeared on over the years. It's the fact that he didn't even appear in front of the camera until he was 67 years old.
Burton Hill Mustin grew up in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, later receiving his degree in civil engineering from Pennsylvania Military College's class of 1903. Over the years, he worked as a car salesman and eventually became an agent for the Better Business Bureau. By the time he eventually retired in Tucson, Arizona with his wife Frances, he had occasionally dabbled in acting and singing as a hobby. But that was about it. He was in for a real surprise when director William Wyler was in the audience for his stage production of Detective Story. Wyler told Mustin to consider a professional acting career and even cast him in his film version of Detective Story starring Kirk Douglas and Eleanor Parker. Mustin explained his fascinating life story in a particularly charming interview on The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson .
Just like that, Mustin's life was starting over in his late 60s and he moved to Los Angeles to pursue more acting work in Hollywood. He appeared as the ""old man"" on pretty much every classic TV series you could think of -- My Three Sons , The Mary Tyler Moore Show , Dragnet , Bonanza , The Twilight Zone , The Red Skelton Hour , Alfred Hitchcock Hour , Love American Style , Bewitched , and more. He had small roles on All In The Family , The Lone Ranger , Petticoat Junction , The Monkees , The Lucy Show , Sanford and Son , Gunsmoke , The Beverly Hillbillies , The Brady Bunch , The Dick Van Dyke Show , The Jack Benny Program , and Get Smart . His IMDB just goes on and on and on.

He appeared in 14 episodes of Andy Griffith , even crossing over into Gomer Pyle U.S.M.C. , and Mayberry R.F.D . At the very end of his career, Mustin appeared in a few episodes of Phyllis as Arthur Lanson, the love interest of Mother Dexter. Just a few months later in 1977, Mustin passed away in Glendale, California at the age of 92. Quite a way to end such a legendary career! While you may not have realized his name, you definitely know Burt Mustin's face and should fondly remember him as one of the most iconic character actors of his time.",source_text/c5cf2ced24f93d7675d2ae2619323d25a03f68c8bb68be168c593d9b6cec528f-bing_chat_1_2.txt,"Whether you remember him from his days as Gus the Fireman on Leave It to Beaver or Jud Fletcher on The Andy Griffith Show, chances are you know Burt Mustin's face.",complete_support,False,beaver - mustin - fireman - gus - leave - burt - jud - fletcher - griffith - quigley,StanfordCitation,0.67,0.48666666666666664,0.4,0.39,[0.9917265176773071],[0.9917265176773071]

If you want to adopt one of the most popular dog breeds, there’s a good chance you’ll choose a German Shepherd Dog. But you also want a purebred dog, which requires you to find out how to identify a purebred German Shepherd. How can you do that?
Here are 7 ways how to identify a purebred German Shepherd:
- Test the DNA.
- Examine the German Shepherd’s coat.
- Examine other German Shepherd physical features.
- Notice their temperament and behavior.
- Examine the registration certificate.
- Check the German Shepherd’s pedigree.
- Talk to the experts.
Purebred German Shepherds have both parents from the same breed. As such, you can readily predict their temperament and physical appearance from the well-established breed standard. But you need to first identify your GSD as a true purebred, so let’s get started.

Identifying a purebred German Shepherd by its physical features can be tricky. This is because there are several other dog breeds with similar characteristics, like the Belgian Malinois, the Bohemian Shepherd, and the Dutch Shepherd, among a few others.
There are also different types of German Shepherds , such as the working lines and show lines which have slightly different appearances.
However, that does not mean identifying a purebred German Shepherd cannot be done.
When you are grappling with the question of how to know if your German Shepherd is original, taking a DNA test on your dog is not something you want to do as a first option.
Why?
Because DNA tests and test kits have a hefty price tag.
In the end, however, you’ll get the best bang for your buck because the DNA test will tell you the genetic breed heritage of your dog, along with other benefits like understanding genetic markers for certain canine diseases.
The most straightforward bet when taking a DNA test on your German Shepherd is to purchase a test kit and follow the instructions on the package.
I recommend the Embark Dog DNA Test Kit from Amazon for the following reasons:
- It captures 200,000 genetic markers, which means high precision on results about your dog’s lineage.
- The test reveals crucial findings on your pet’s health, like your dog’s predisposition to drug sensitivities and possible genetic diseases.
- It’s easy to use.
In summary, all you need to do with the DNA test kit is follow these steps:
- Purchase the Embark Dog DNA Test Kit from Amazon
- Once the kit is delivered, use the activation code to create a tracking account on embark.com.
- Pass the swab inside your dog’s mouth to collect the DNA sample.
- Package the swab with the DNA sample in the provided sealable bag and mail it for testing.
If you seek greater accuracy, go for the 2-pack option and use both with your GSD to check the consistency of results.
A dog’s coat is one of the signature features of breed uniqueness that’s used as part of the breed standard. You can identify if your German Shepherd is purebred by assessing your dog for these coat features.
According to the AKC, the official standard o f the GSD is a medium-length double coat with tough straight hair lying close to the body. The outer coat should be dense, even though a somewhat wavy outer coat is permissible.
The hairs at the neck are longer and thicker, while those on the head, fore face, and inside the ears are short. The paws and legs also have short hair, but you may notice slightly longer hair at the rear of the legs, on the hock, and along the pastern.

As a difference, the Kennel Club and the FCI standards include a long coat to their German Shepherd breed standards. I’ve written a complete article all about the long-haired German Shepherd if this variety interests you.
The coat colors of the German Shepherd are varied. The black and tan, sable , black and red, bi-color, and solid black variants are among the most common German Shepherd coat colors.
The AKC advocates for strong-rich colors and disqualifies blue , livers, white , and faded German Shepherd coat colors ( even though GSDs with these colors can still be registered ). These colors are also undesirable for the Kennel Club, and the FCI disqualifies white coats as well.
Variations in German Shepherd coat standards should suggest the need to consider more than just the coat type and fur patterns when trying to make out if your German Shepherd is an original.
You can combine assessing the coat type and color of the German Shepherd with examining other physical features of the breed to make a more informed conclusion about your GSD’s bloodline.
Some of the distinctive physical features of the German Shepherd you should look for include the following characteristics.
If your dog has a strong, proportionate, well-muscled, but agile body, then it’s likely you have an original.
Other features of a strong-build purebred German Shepherd you should notice include:
- An even built hindquarter and the forequarter.
- A body that’s longer than it is tall.
- Height: 24″-26″ (61cm-66cm) for the male and 22″-24″ (56cm-61cm) for the female.
- Length: Around 36″-42″ (91cm-106cm).
- A noble look with a well-defined feminine or masculine gait for either case.
- A deep and narrow chest with sloping shoulders and front legs.
The pointy ears of a German Shepherd are among its most popular signature features. The GSD typically carries its ears erect, with the ear ends parallel to each other and vertical to the ground.
But the ears of your German Shepherd may not stand erect until the teething period is over.
If your GSD is at that teething stage, which ends around weeks 16 and 20, check to see if your dog has erect ears when it hears a sound, barks, or gets excited. If that happens even for short moments, your puppy’s ears will stand erect permanently after the teething period.
Note that floppy ears in adult purebred German Shepherds can be a sign of ill health or the outcome of grooming routines. Also, breed standards usually disqualify a GSD with docked ears.
The German Shepherd has a full and long bushy tail with the last interlocking bone extending to the hock joint.
The tail is carried low rather than high and is smoothly set into the rump.
A purebred German Shepherd should not carry the tail curled forward as though fearful. When at rest, your GSD’s tail will hang with a slight curve. The curve can be more pronounced when the dog is excited or moving. You can read about the meaning of German Shepherd tail positions in this article.
As with the ears, a docked German Shepherd’s tail is cause for disqualification as per breed standards.
Other defining features of a German Shepherd to look for include:
- A noble head that’s proportional to the body.
- A long and strong muzzle with a topline parallel to the skull.
- A black nose.
- A strong and muscular neck with smooth skin and no loose skin folds.
Your purebred German Shepherd will present as a confident, fearless, and alert dog. Timidity, nervousness, and anxiety are not part of the intelligent and agile German Shepherd, originally bred as a herding dog.
Any characterizing tendency to flee and hide behind the owner or handler should suggest that the dog is not a purebred German Shepherd. While your purebred dog will be friendly and loyal to you, it will show some aloofness towards strangers without, however, being aggressive or showing a lack of confidence.
All these features of a confident German Shepherd’s character should manifest in a typical gait of a working dog.
A dog registration certificate is the record of a puppy’s birth with a registry such as the AKC in the US or the Kennel Club in the UK. A registered dog is what we usually refer to as “a dog with papers.”
Dog registries simply maintain the record of dog ownership and breeding, whether your dog is a purebred or a mixed breed. That could leave you wondering how a dog registration certificate can help identify a purebred German Shepherd. Here’s how.
A German Shepherd registration certificate only goes back one generation and will only show the parents’ names and breed, among other details. That should tell you if both parents of your German Shepherd were of the same breed or not.
However, the information given to a dog registry is self-reported by the owner or breeder. The registry does not do background research to confirm the details but instead relies on the honesty of the breeder or owner.
Nonetheless, a German Shepherd with a registration certificate that records parents of the same breed, implying that it is purebred, has a higher probability of being an original than one that’s not registered.
When determining if your German Shepherd is an original, you might want to combine assessing the dog’s registration certificate with some of the methods discussed earlier.
A dog pedigree is a certificate of your dog’s birth that also records the dog’s bloodline, going back at least three generations in the dog’s family tree.
Your purebred German Shepherd papers should include the dog’s registration certificate and pedigree papers. In addition, pedigree papers will show your dog’s physical details like the coat color and any titles the dog or previous dogs in the bloodline may have won.
Compared to a simple dog registration certificate, a dog’s pedigree has more proof that your German Shepherd is purebred.
Experts in your dog’s lineage are people with firsthand information about your German Shepherd and those with extensive information about the breed.
Firsthand info experts can be the dog’s breeder or an owner with a long history of owning one or more German Shepherds. Experts with extensive knowledge about the breed are mainly veterinarians.
To determine if your German Shepherd is purebred, talk to a reputable breeder with years of experience with the breed.
You can find reliable breeders through kennel club initiatives such as the AKC’s Breeder Referral Search or The Kennel Club’s Find an Assured Breeder . National breed clubs are also an option, as in the case of the German Shepherd Do g Club of America .
Reputable German Shepherd breeders will give you reliable info about:
- German Shepherd dog personality and temperament.
- Key purebred German Shepherd features and how they manifest in different stages of the dog’s development .
- German Shepherd registration and pedigree papers, especially if you are considering buying your GSD from the breeder.
- Possible German Shepherd health issues, as they can make you doubt your dog’s originality if you don’t know about them.
Someone who has owned a purebred German Shepherd for years has observed their physical and personality traits and can offer you valuable information about the breed.
Go for a purebred German Shepherd owner whose dog you like and looks healthy and well cared for. Fulfilled GSD owners will be glad to tell you about their furry companions and probably show you photos and videos of their growth journey.
Videos and photos of another purebred German Shepherd can give you specific details about physical features and temperament traits that you can look out for in your own dog.
Veterinarians not only deal with many dog breeds, but they also attend to many dogs of the same breed. As such, they have mastered characteristics proper to the GSD and will give you purebred German Shepherd facts and proofs from their own experience.
Suppose you already own the dog that you are trying to identify as purebred. In that case, you can bring your dog to a vet who has vast experience with German Shepherds and have them assess the dog’s physical, temperament, and behavior traits.
Alternatively, you can explain to the vet features and behaviors you have observed in your dog and have the vet tell you if they are typical of the breed.

Many German Shepherd owners have found themselves grappling with the question, “how can I tell if my German Shepherd is purebred?”
While testing your dog’s DNA is the most conclusive way to tell if your German Shepherd is an original, you can go for other less pricey options. Observe your dog for breed-specific traits and behavior, assess the dog’s registration and pedigree papers, or talk to experts.
I suggest you combine more than one of these options for a more conclusive answer about your German Shepherd’s pure bloodline.

First off, how do you define a mountain? It is generally considered to be a natural elevation rising to a summit, attaining an altitude greater than 1,969 feet (600m), and with a prominence of at least 98 feet (30m) above the surrounding landscape in all directions, according to the Simms classification.
Scotland is the most mountainous country in the UK with the most peaks in the Highlands, the area north and west of the Highland Boundary Fault. The highest peaks in England are clustered around the Lake District, again in the northwest of the country, while Snowdonia National Park has the highest peaks in Wales.
When taken as separate countries, the highest mountains in the UK are as follows:
- The highest mountain in Scotland, and also the highest in mainland UK, is Ben Nevis at 4,411 feet (1345m).
- The highest mountain in Wales is Snowdon at 3,560 feet (1085m) in the northwest county of Gwynedd.
- England’s highest mountain is Scafell Pike, at 3,209 feet (978m) and is located in the Lake District National Park in Cumbria, northwest England.
- Northern Ireland’s highest mountain is Slieve Donard at 2,789 feet (850m). Located in the Mourne Mountains, about 33 miles south of Belfast, it is the 7th highest mountain in Ireland as a whole.
However, if you include all the British territories, Mount Hope in the British Antarctic Territory wins as Britain’s highest mountain at 10,626 feet (3239m). It was only in 2017 that Mount Hope’s true elevation was measured using GPS and it officially became Britain’s highest peak. However, compared to Mount Everest in the Himalayas at 29,028 feet (8848m) and Mont Blanc in the French-Italian Alps at 15,781 feet (4810m), nothing in the UK even comes close.

Read on to learn about the highest mountains in the UK.
This list of the top 10 highest mountains in the UK in order, is listed by overall height. They are all in Scotland and are all Munros.
The highest peak in Scotland and in the UK, Ben Nevis is near Fort William, at the western end of the Grampians in northwest Scotland. It attracts over 100,000 walkers who mostly ascend using the Pony Track route from Glen Nevis. The north face cliffs are one of the toughest challenges for mountaineers and ice climbers. The summit, a volcanic caldera, still has ruins of the meteorological observatory that operated from 1883 to 1904.
Britain’s second highest peak is Ben Macdui in the Scottish Highlands. It is the highest peak in the Cairngorms National Park which is the largest national park in the UK covering over 1,700 square miles. The easiest ascent is a 4 mile route starting from the Cairngorm Ski Centre. A detour can be included to “bag” Cairn Gorm along the way. Other routes are possible but all involve a slow and steady trek. One option is to cycle from the Linn of Dee to Derry Lodge (about 2.5 miles) and then ascend the southern side. The summit with its bare boulder field has a toposcope identifying the surrounding mountains, erected in 1925.
Located in the western massif of the Cairngorms, Braeriach is known for its corries which harbour year-round snow pockets. Most walkers ascend Braeriach from the Sugar Bowl car park near the Cairn Gorm ski area and the arduous walk is 5.6 miles each way. The path navigates the steep-side ravine of Chalamain Gap and Lairig Ghru Pass before reaching the summit.
Cairn Toul is linked by a mountain pass to Braeriach and towers above the western side of Lairig Ghru Pass. Due to its location, Cairn Toul is often climbed in conjunction with other neighbouring peaks including The Devils; Point, Braeriach and Sgor an Lochain Uaine. It necessitates a long trip, often over two days and may entail a stay at the isolated Corrour Bothy refuge overnight. The ascent includes all types of terrain from scree and boulder fields to boggy areas.
Located in the Cairngorms, Sgor an Lochain Uaine is a remote peak often ascended along with other peaks. From the north, walkers must first ascend Braeriach and from the south the route includes Cairn Toul and Devil’s Point. It has a small loch on the northeast side of the summit and its name appropriately means “Peak of the Little Green Loch”.
Set in the Scottish Highlands overlooking the ski resort and town of Aviemore, Cairn Gorm gives its name to the whole range of mountains. The northwest slopes are used for downhill skiing in winter and they are served by the funicular Cairngorm Mountain Railway, the highest railway in the UK. The one mile line ends at the Ptarmigan building some 1087m up Cairn Gorm. Most ascents are on the north side although high winds and blizzards can make it impassable. The summit houses an automated weather station transmitting wind speed and temperature data. Look for the remote Loch Avon from the southern side of the summit.
Close to Fort William and just 2 miles east of Ben Nevis, Aonach Beag is connected to Aonach Mor by a mountain pass or high saddle. The easiest ascent starts by taking the gondola lift on Aonach Mor to 650m and then walk along the ridge joining the twin peaks. It can also be climbed in more isolated conditions from Glen Nevis to the south. The north face of Aonach Beag has one of the longest existing snow patches at the bottom of the Queens View climb at a height of 950m.
Aonach Mor is popular for skiing and snowboarding and in summer the gondola ski lift is used by hikers, paragliders and mountain bikers wanting to descend the downhill mountain bike track. The mountain hosts the Mountain Bike World Cup and other championships. Climbers can use the ski gondola for the first ascent of 2,100 ft (650m) and then walk to the summit. Aonach Mor can also be tackled from the south side. Most walkers also ascend Aonach Berg via the high bealach (pass).
Connected to Ben Nevis via the spectacular Carn Mor Dearg Arête, Carn Mor Searg is the 8th highest mountain in the UK. It offers an excellent horseshoe route starting from the North Face car park, traversing the arête and then descending to the CIC Hut. In good conditions, climbers can reach the summit from the ski area in two hours.
Ben Lawers is the highest peak in Perthshire. It is on the watershed between the Tay and Lyon Rivers and water is channelled into the Breadalbane Hydro-Electric Power Station. The mountain is a National Nature Reserve and has an exceptional diversity of artic-alpine plants and flora including alpine forget-me-not and saxifrages. There is a National Trust car park on the western side and a path leads to the summit. The lower section of the path is a nature trail and the path ascend to the summit of Ben Lawers via the Beinn Ghlas peak. Alternative routes follow Lawers Burn and the east ridge. There's also an event that occurs here once each year, called the Artemis Kindrochit Great Quadrathlon that involves running 15 miles across 7 peaks with a swim, bike and kayak thrown in for good measure!
According to the International Climbing and Mountaineering Federation, height and prominence are the most important factors when comparing mountains. While some of the tallest mountains in terms of overall size start on the seabed, other summits are a mere bump on the side of another mountain. We will be listing the highest mountains in the UK by height. Anything below 2,000 feet or 609m is considered a hill.
Some classifications of mountains are often grouped together for different purposes. For example, “Munro bagging” involves climbing all the mountains in Scotland over 3000 feet (914.4m). It’s a lifelong challenge to climb them all and achieve the kudos as a “Munroist”.
Here are the definitions of some of the main mountain classifications in the UK:
P600s are mountains anywhere in the British Isles with a prominence above 1,969 feet (600m) regardless of the overall height of the mountain. There are 120 P600s; 81 in Scotland, 25 in Ireland (just 1 in Northern Ireland), 8 in Wales and 4 in England.
Hewitt is the acronym for Hills in England, Wales and Ireland over Two Thousand feet. They must have a relative height of 98 feet (30m). The latest list (2019) has 525 Hewitts: 209 in Ireland, 180 in England and 136 in Wales.
Simms are “metric Hewitts” and the list was devised in 2010. They need to be at least 1,968 feet (600m) in height and have a minimum prominence of 98.4 feet (30m). Using this definition, there are 2,754 Simms in the British Isles. This list is maintained by the DoBIH – the Database of British and Irish Hills
Compiled in 1989 by avid mountain walkers John and Anne Nuttall, Nuttalls are mountains in England and Wales only. They must be over 2,000 feet (610m) with a relative height of 49 feet (15m) so they include many smaller tops than other classes. There are 444 Nuttalls.
There are 282 Munros. These are peaks in Scotland exceeding 3,000 feet or 914.4m. There is no set prominence, but Munros must be seen as a separate mountain. This list was compiled in 1891 by Scottish mountaineer Sir Hugh Munro. Subsidiary summits are called Munro Tops, of which there are 227.
Murdos are any Munro in Scotland (over 3,000 feet or 914.4m high) with a prominence of at least 98 feet (30m). There are 442 Murdos.
Furths have the same criteria as Scottish Munros but are located elsewhere in the British Isles. There are 34 Furths: 15 in Wales, 13 in Ireland and 6 in England.
The Corbetts only include mountains in Scotland which are between 2500 and 3000 feet (762 and 914.4m) with a prominence of at least 55 feet (152m). There are currently 221 Corbetts on the list, which is maintained by the Scottish Mountaineering Club.
The next lowest group is the Grahams, Scottish mountains between 2000 and 2500 feet (609.6 and 762m). The updated list has 221 Grahams.
Donalds are hills in the Scottish Lowlands exceeding 2000 feet (609.6m). It includes 89 summits and 51 subsidiary tops.
There are 1216 Marilyns in Scotland. These are hills with a relative height of 492 feet (150m) above their surroundings regardless of their total height.
HuMPs were devised and published by Mark Jackson as recently as 2010. HuMPs are the acronym for “Hundred and Upwards Metre Prominence” mountains. Similar to Scottish Marilyns, HuMPs are mountains of any height with a prominence of 330 feet (100m). There are 2,986 HuMPs in the British Isles: 2,168 in Scotland, 833 in Ireland, 444 in England, 366 in Wales and 11 in the Channel Islands.
Mark Jackson produced another classification of mountains in 2010, known as TuMPs (Thirty and Upwards Metre Prominence). This covers all hills and mountains in Britain that stand at least 98 feet (30m) above the surrounding land on all sides. Not surprisingly, this is an extensive list with 17,044 named TuMPs. The list is now maintained by the Database of British and Irish Hills.
These are the main classifications of mountains in the British Isles, but there are others. These different classifications create very different rankings for mountains. For example, Scafell Pike is the highest mountain in England, but only the 257th highest in the British Isles as per Simms. It is 138th on the Marilyn classification and the 46th highest mountain on the P600. As with many other mountains, Scafell Pike is included in various classifications as a Marilyn, HuMP, Furth, Hewitt and a Nuttall. It is often the prominence of a mountain summit, as well as the height, that defines its classification.

Published on EST
CBC’s Kim’s Convenience will be returning to Netflix for its third season on April 3rd, 2019 in the United States, the United Kingdom, and Australia.
Kim’s Convenience is one of several shows Netflixers around the world enjoys from CBC. The biggest from the network have been hits like Heartland and Northern Rescue but in the comedy genre, Netflix also is currently enjoying new seasons of Schitt’s Creek and Workin’ Moms which recently became a Netflix Original.
The series first arrived on Netflix in July 2018 when Netflix nabbed the first two seasons from CBC. Each season consisted of 13 episodes apiece.
Season 3 aired on CBC in Canada from January 2019 and once again consists of 13 episodes. The series is due to air its finale on April 2nd, 2019 in Canada which means Netflix is getting the new season just a day after the series wraps up.
The third season continues to the stories of the Kim’s who run a convenience store. Season 3 continues previous storylines with Paul, Sun-Hyung Lee, Jean Yoon, Andrea Bang, and Simu Liu all returning.
It’s worth noting that the series wasn’t initially included in the April 2019 new releases list and we only got word of its impending Netflix release on March 27th.
Netflix will continue being the primary place for Kim’s Convenience in most regions of the world.
We also believe that Kim’s Convenience will be arriving on Netflix in Canada throughout April 2019 but we’ve yet to confirm that it is the case.
Previously, it’s taken a few months before new seasons come to Netflix in Canada.
The even better news is that Kim’s Convenience is that the show already has its future secured. Season 4 was renewed back in May 2018.
Given the quick renewal, we’d expect the series to air in Canada in late 2019 or early 2020 and then arrive on Netflix once again shortly thereafter.
Are you looking forward to watching season 3 of Kim’s Convenience on Netflix? Let us know in the comments.

Indoor temperatures are often more controlled and consistent, which can make even small changes noticeable. Additionally, indoor air quality can be affected by temperature changes, which can impact our health and comfort. In contrast, outdoor temperatures are subject to natural fluctuations and we have evolved to adapt to these changes over time. However, extreme weather events caused by climate change can still have negative impacts on our health and well-being.","However, extreme weather events caused by climate change can still have negative impacts on our health and well-being.","Global temperatures rose about 1.98°F
(1.1°C) from 1901 to 2020, but climate change refers to more than an increase in temperature. It also includes sea level rise, changes in weather patterns like drought and flooding, and much more. Things that we depend upon and value — water, energy, transportation, wildlife, agriculture, ecosystems, and human health — are experiencing the effects of a changing climate.
The impacts of climate change on different sectors of society are interrelated. Drought can harm food production and human health. Flooding can lead to disease spread and damages to ecosystems and infrastructure. Human health issues can increase mortality, impact food availability, and limit worker productivity. Climate change impacts are seen throughout every aspect of the world we live in. However, climate change impacts are uneven across the country and the world — even within a single community, climate change impacts can differ between neighborhoods or individuals. Long-standing socioeconomic inequities can make underserved groups, who often have the highest exposure to hazards and the fewest resources to respond, more vulnerable.
The projections of a climate change-impacted future are not inevitable. Many of the problems and solutions
are known to us now, and ongoing research continues to provide new ones. Experts believe there is still time to avoid the most negative of outcomes by limiting warming
and reducing emissions to zero as quickly as possible. Reducing our emissions of greenhouse gases will require investment in new technology and infrastructure, which will spur job growth. Additionally, lowering emissions will lessen harmful impacts to human health, saving countless lives and billions of dollars in health-related expenses.
We see climate change affecting our planet from pole to pole. NOAA monitors global climate data and here are some of the changes NOAA has recorded. You can explore more at the Global Climate Dashboard .
- Global temperatures rose about 1.8°F (1°C) from 1901 to 2020.
- Sea level rise has accelerated from 1.7 mm/year throughout most of the twentieth century to 3.2 mm/year since 1993.
- Glaciers are shrinking: average thickness of 30 well-studied glaciers has decreased more than 60 feet since 1980.
- The area covered by sea ice in the Arctic at the end of summer has shrunk by about 40% since 1979.
- The amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere has risen by 25% since 1958, and by about 40% since the Industrial Revolution.
- Snow is melting earlier compared to long-term averages.
Changes to water resources can have a big impact on our world and our lives.
Flooding is an increasing issue as our climate is changing. Compared to the beginning of the 20th century, there are both stronger and more frequent abnormally heavy precipitation events across most of the United States.
Conversely, drought is also becoming more common , particularly in the Western United States. Humans are using more water, especially for agriculture. Much like we sweat more when it is hot out, higher air temperatures cause plants to lose, or transpire , more water, meaning farmers must give them more water. Both highlight the need for more water in places where supplies are dwindling.
Snowpack is an important source of fresh water for many people. As the snow melts, fresh water becomes available for use, especially in regions like the Western United States where there is not much precipitation in warmer months. But as temperatures warm, there is less snow overall and snow begins to melt earlier in the year, meaning snowpack may not be a reliable source of water for the entire warm and dry seasons.
Our food supply depends on climate and weather conditions. Although farmers and researchers may be able to adapt some agricultural techniques and technologies or develop new ones, some changes will be difficult to manage. Increased temperatures, drought and water stress, diseases, and weather extremes create challenges for the farmers and ranchers who put food on our tables.
Human farm workers can suffer from heat-related health issues , like exhaustion, heatstroke, and heart attacks. Rising temperatures and heat stress can also harm livestock.
Climate change is already impacting human health . Changes in weather and climate patterns can put lives at risk. Heat is one of the most deadly weather phenomena. As ocean temperatures rise, hurricanes are getting stronger and wetter , which can cause direct and indirect deaths . Dry conditions lead to more wildfires, which bring many health risks . Higher incidences of flooding can lead to the spread of waterborne diseases, injuries, and chemical hazards. As geographic ranges of mosquitoes and ticks expand, they can carry diseases to new locations.
The most vulnerable groups, including children, the elderly, people with preexisting health conditions, outdoor workers, people of color, and people with low income, are at an even higher risk because of the compounding factors from climate change. But public health groups can work with local communities to help people understand and build resilience to climate change health impacts.
Climate change will continue to have a significant impact on ecosystems and organisms, though they are not impacted equally. The Arctic is one of the ecosystems most vulnerable to the effects of climate change, as it is warming at least twice the rate of the global average and melting land ice sheets and glaciers contribute dramatically
to sea level rise around the globe.
Some living things are able to respond to climate change; some plants are blooming earlier and some species may expand their geographic range. But these changes are happening too fast for many other plants and animals as increasing temperatures and changing precipitation patterns stress ecosystems. Some invasive or nuisance species, like lionfish and ticks , may thrive in even more places because of climate change.
Changes are also occurring in the ocean. The ocean absorbs about 30% of the carbon dioxide that is released into the atmosphere from the burning of fossil fuels. As a result, the water is becoming more acidic , affecting marine life. Sea levels are rising due to thermal expansion, in addition to melting ice sheets and glaciers, putting coastal areas at greater risk of erosion and storm surge.
The compounding effects of climate change are leading to many changes in ecosystems. Coral reefs are vulnerable to many effects of climate change: warming waters can lead to coral bleaching, stronger hurricanes can destroy reefs, and sea level rise can cause corals to be smothered by sediment. Coral reef ecosystems are home to thousands of species, which rely on healthy coral reefs to survive.
As future leaders who will make decisions about the issues they face in their communities, the Museum of Science and Industry positioned high school-aged teens to act as advocates for building the city’s resilience to the impacts and consequences of global climate change.
Physical infrastructure includes bridges, roads, ports, electrical grids, broadband internet, and other parts of our transportation and communication systems. It is often designed to be in use for years or decades, and many communities have infrastructure that was designed without future climate in mind. But even newer infrastructures can be vulnerable to climate change.
Extreme weather events that bring heavy rains, floods, wind, snow, or temperature changes can stress existing structures and facilities. Increased temperatures require more indoor cooling, which can put stress on an energy grid. Sudden heavy rainfall can lead to flooding that shuts down highways and major business areas.
Nearly 40% of the United States population lives in coastal counties, meaning millions of people will be impacted by sea level rise. Coastal infrastructure , such as roads, bridges, water supplies, and much more, is at risk. Sea level rise can also lead to coastal erosion and high-tide flooding . Some communities are projected to possibly end up at or below sea level by 2100 and will face decisions around managed retreat and climate adaptation.
Many communities are not yet prepared to face climate-related threats. Even within a community, some groups are more vulnerable to these threats than others. Going forward, it is important for communities to invest in resilient infrastructure that will be able to withstand future climate risks. Researchers are studying current and future impacts of climate change on communities and can offer recommendations on best practices. Resilience education is vitally important for city planners, emergency managers, educators, communicators, and all other community members to prepare for climate change.",source_text/f1f9ec4dbffa5ccc574b7cabb0d3222d8b5d1a20af76ccd678a29194a4c02ec7-perplexity_3_0.txt,"Extreme weather events that bring heavy rains, floods, wind, snow, or temperature changes can stress existing structures and facilities.

Some argue that it is a basic healthcare need for millions of women and girls, while others believe that denying access to abortion is a violation of human rights. There are also federal and state laws in place that restrict access to abortion.","Some argue that it is a basic healthcare need for millions of women and girls, while others believe that denying access to abortion is a violation of human rights.","Access to safe and legal abortion is a matter of human rights, and its availability is the best way to protect autonomy and reduce maternal mortality and morbidity.
Is abortion a human rights issue?
Access to safe, legal abortion is a matter of human rights. Authoritative interpretations of international human rights law establish that denying women, girls, and other pregnant people access to abortion is a form of discrimination and jeopardizes a range of human rights. United Nations human rights treaty bodies regularly call for governments to decriminalize abortion in all cases and to ensure access to safe, legal abortion in certain circumstances at a minimum.
What are the human rights consequences of restricting or banning abortion access?
Countries have obligations to respect, protect, and fulfill human rights, including those concerning sexual and reproductive health and autonomy. Where safe and legal abortion services are unreasonably restricted or not fully available, many other internationally protected human rights may be at risk, including rights to nondiscrimination and equality; to life, health, and information; to freedom from torture and cruel, inhuman and degrading treatment; to privacy and bodily autonomy and integrity; to decide the number and spacing of children; to liberty; to enjoy the benefits of scientific progress; and to freedom of conscience and religion.
These rights are set out the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, and protected in many international treaties, including the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights (ICESCR), the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR), the Convention Against Torture (CAT), the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women (CEDAW), and the Convention on the Rights of the Child (CRC), as well as in regional level treaties in Africa, the Americas, and Europe.
For nearly two decades, Human Rights Watch has documented the human rights harm of restricted or banned access to abortion in countries around the world, including in the US , Ecuador , Argentina , Brazil , the Dominican Republic , and Ireland .
What is the Human Rights Watch position on abortion?
Human Rights Watch believes that reproductive rights are human rights, including the right to access to abortion. States have the obligation to provide women, girls, and other pregnant people with access to safe and legal abortion as part of their core human rights responsibilities.
As Human Rights Watch has stated in amicus curiae briefs to high courts in countries around the world – from Brazil and Colombia to South Korea and most recently with partner organizations in the United States – international human rights law and relevant jurisprudence support the conclusion that decisions about abortion belong to a pregnant person alone, without interference or unreasonable restriction by the state or third parties.
Is the right to life at risk when access to abortion is restricted or banned?
Yes. Legal restrictions on abortion often result in more illegal abortions, which may also be unsafe and may drive higher maternal mortality and morbidity. As a result, lack of access to safe and legal abortion puts the lives of pregnant people at risk.
According to the World Health Organization (WHO), complications from pregnancy and childbirth are the leading cause of death for girls and young women ages 15 to 19, and children ages 10 to 14 have a higher risk of health complications and death from pregnancy than adults. WHO has also found that the removal of restrictions on abortion results in the reduction of maternal mortality .
The UN Human Rights Committee (HRC), which monitors states’ compliance with the ICCPR , has noted the relationship between restrictive abortion laws and threats to women’s and girls’ lives. It has explicitly clarified that states parties cannot regulate access to abortion in any way that requires pregnant people to resort to unsafe abortions, and that states must provide safe, legal, and effective access to abortion to prevent risk to the lives and health of pregnant people, and to ensure that they are not subject to substantial pain or suffering, most notably in cases where pregnancy is the result of rape or incest, or the pregnancy is not viable.
Do restrictive abortion policies reduce the rate of abortions?
Abortion restrictions do not prevent abortions. Research has shown that when abortion is banned or restricted, the number of abortions does not decrease. Abortions just move underground. This increases the risk both of unsafe procedures and that people will be reported to police or prosecuted for suspected abortions.
The rate of unsafe abortions is nearly 45 times higher in countries with highly restrictive abortion laws than in countries where abortion is legal and unrestricted.
Restrictive abortion policies push pregnant people seeking abortions, especially those living in poverty or rural areas , out of the healthcare system and into unsafe, unregulated settings. WHO has also stated that lack of access to safe, affordable, timely, and respectful abortion care, as well as the promotion of stigma associated with abortion, poses risks to abortion seekers’ physical and mental well-being throughout their lives.
Who will be most harmed from restrictions on access to abortion?
Not all pregnant people are likely to experience the human rights and health harm of restricting abortion equally. Young people and marginalized groups including Black, Indigenous, and other people of color, people living in economic poverty, and sexual and gender minorities are more likely to be harmed. The UN Human Rights Committee has held that lack of availability of reproductive health information and services, including abortion, undermines women’s right to nondiscrimination.
The UN Human Rights Committee, like the Committee on the Elimination on Discrimination Against Women, has also noted that restrictions on abortion result in the disproportionate practice of illegal, unsafe abortions by poor and rural women or women unable to travel outside a jurisdiction where abortion is banned. The UN Committee on the Rights of the Child has also said that punitive abortion laws constitute a violation of children’s right to freedom from discrimination.
Even where abortion is technically legal, heavy restrictions can make it inaccessible to marginalized people. This forces pregnant people, particularly from marginalized groups, to look for unsafe and clandestine abortion opportunities and to risk criminal or civil penalties, even when their circumstances fall within what is legally permissible.
Moreover, the Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights has said, “[a] wide range of laws, policies and practices undermine the autonomy and right to equality and non-discrimination in the full enjoyment of the right to sexual and reproductive health, for example criminalization of abortion or restrictive abortion laws.” It has also noted that restrictions on abortion particularly affect women living in poverty or without or with less formal education. Similarly, six UN experts stressed in a 2015 joint news release that in El Salvador, “the total ban on abortion disproportionately affects women who are poor.”
What has the UN said about lack of access to and criminalization of abortion?
UN human rights treaty bodies, which monitor countries’ compliance with relevant treaties and that report or advise on human rights related to specific themes or countries, have consistently called for decriminalization of abortion and the full realization of sexual and reproductive rights, including access to safe, legal abortion.
Examples of statements from these mechanisms in relation to abortion include the following:
The CEDAW Committee, which monitors compliance with CEDAW, stated that:
Unsafe abortion is a leading cause of maternal mortality and morbidity. As such, States parties should legalize abortion at least in cases of rape, incest, threats to the life and/or health of the mother, or severe fetal impairment, as well as provide women with access to quality post-abortion care, especially in cases of complications resulting from unsafe abortions. States parties should also remove punitive measures for women who undergo abortion.
The committee has made similar recommendations to many governments while reviewing their compliance with the treaty. These recommendations typically call on governments to decriminalize abortion in all cases, legalize abortion in the circumstances noted above, and guarantee access.
The Human Rights Committee , which monitors states’ compliance with the ICCPR, has noted the relationship between restrictive abortion laws and threats to women’s and girls’ lives and has clarified the scope of States parties’ obligations to protect their right to life. In particular, “restrictions on the ability of women or girls to seek abortion must not, inter alia, jeopardize their lives.” The committee has frequently expressed concern about criminalization of abortion and has called for expanded access.
Like the CEDAW Committee, the Human Rights Committee , the Committee on Economic Social and Cultural Rights (which monitors the ICESCR), and the Committee against Torture , (which monitors CAT), have called the removal of penalties for abortion and for the implementation of measures to ensure safe, legal access to abortion. Where safe abortion is not available it can pose risks to mental health , including severe anguish and risk of suicide . The tie between mental health and restrictions in access to reproductive health is so clear that the UN Committee against Torture has expressed concern at the severe physical and mental anguish and distress experienced by women and girls due to abortion restrictions, and concluded that criminalization and inaccessibility of abortion can be incompatible with a government’s duty to uphold the right to freedom from torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment.
Similarly, the UN Committee on the Rights of the Child has urged states to “decriminalize abortion to ensure that girls have access to safe abortion and post-abortion services, review legislation with a view to guaranteeing the best interests of pregnant adolescents and ensure that their views are always heard and respected in abortion-related decisions.” In many individual state reviews of treaty compliance, called concluding observations, the committee explicitly called for decriminalization of abortion “in all circumstances.”
The UN special rapporteur on the right to health has said that criminal laws penalizing and restricting induced abortion are “impermissible barriers to the realization of women’s right to health and must be eliminated.”",source_text/9f782bc736e77a5971c0d9c784ed2de107952d63b8ca52ad58317336698e5934-perplexity_0_1.txt,"Access to safe and legal abortion is a matter of human rights, and its availability is the best way to protect autonomy and reduce maternal mortality and morbidity.

My mind simply cannot grasp the concept of a printer that can make an actual gun that can shoot real bullets.,"A 3D printer works by creating a 3D model layer by layer, building it on a bed surface from the bottom up. It does this by depositing filament (usually plastic) in certain places. The process starts with creating a 3D model using software such as TinkerCAD, Fusion360 or Sketchup. Once you have successfully created your 3D model, you have to slice it into layers that can be printed.

The world of 3D printing has been raised to a greater extent in the last few decades. Right from basic household accessories to viable personal protective equipment, there are a lot of things that Selective Laser Sintering (SLS) services have served as. 3D printing Services have eased up everything and have made it easier for people to know about different products in detail through their 3D models. But still, there are some concepts that even the best artists struggle on for elaborating the glorious world of Selective laser sintering.
Simple photos and sketches can provide us a good idea about the concept but there are still some concepts that fail to explain through photos and sketches completely. A 3D model is a prototype that you can touch on hold and feel. 3D models are quite important for businesses. The 3D models were already there in the marketplace for ages but the only thing that differs them from the modern ones is that they were being made by hand. Whether it is the aerospace industry, medical industry, dental industry, or laser beam, 3D printing platform is being consistently used everywhere.
Creating such 3D models with hands is a hectic task and that is the same reason why related machines were introduced into the marketplace. 3D printing software has boosted up the manufacturing of prototypes. These printers not only ease up your tasks but are quite fast and cost-effective too. The guide is specially designed to introduce you to the exact functioning of a 3D printer.
Before exploring the working process of a 3D printer, it gets quite important for a person to know what exactly it is. 3D Printing is an additive manufacturing process that is being used to design and construct three-dimensional solid objects. The 3D scan uses a computer-aided design that is also known as CAD for creating three-dimensional objects from digital files.
The process works on the layering method where successive layers of the materials are being laid down layer by layer until the final 3D print is being created. The entire process of 3D printing is being done by adding layers on each other and hence also known as additive manufacturing technologies. Users can easily see the thinly sliced layers in a fine cross-section of the object. The 3D printing process usually includes different types of layering materials such as plastics, composites, metal objects, or bio-materials. The best thing about 3D printing is that it can effectively create objects in different shapes, sizes, rigidity, and colors.
If you are willing to produce complex shapes using fewer materials, 3D printing can serve to be a great option for you. The introduction of 3D printing machines has eased up our lives to a greater extent. 3D printing platforms are currently serving as a major aspect of everyone’s lives. Right from packaging food-grade items to pharmaceutical industries, there is a wide range of possibilities for 3D prints.
The word 3D printing is not a newer one in the marketplace. Right from hand-made 3D prototypes to rapid 3D prototyping, it has to take a long way to go. The best thing about 3D printers is the extreme flexibility of printing. One can easily make use of plastics for printing rigid materials such as sunglasses and can also create flexible objects like phone cases or bike handles with the 3D printers effectively. You can even find some 3D printers in the market that can have the ability of printing with carbon fibers and metallic powders. These types of 3D printers are most commonly used in constructing strong industrial products.
The introduction of 3D printers has put on a greater impact on everyone’s life. 3D printers are known for their extreme flexibility. They not only provide a wide range of opportunities to the users but also can be effectively used with a wide range of materials. The 3D printer includes a very simple and intuitive interface that makes access quite easier. You can print your preferred 3D print with these machines without making many efforts.
Adding more to it, the 3D printers are incredibly fast and accurate. They actually can serve to be a promising tool for future manduction. The majority of the 3D printers available in the market are designed to ensure rapid prototyping. Everyone wants to have a faster work speed and that’s why the demand for 3D printers has rapidly increased in the last few years. The majority of the companies all around the world have started using 3D printers for creating their prototypes in just a matter of a few minutes. 3D printers claim to be about 10 times faster and five times cheaper than normal R&D processes.
3D printing now has become a very important part of almost every industry. They not only just create the prototypes rapidly but also provide absolute finishing to them. Right from fixing the broken parts of the ventilators to print complete homes, from providing absolute learning sessions in schools to creating robotics pieces, 3D printing is now serving as a great help in every industry. The presence of features like adaptability and flexibility has made this technology a compulsion in every field.
The world of 3D printing is quite huge. This technology has become a game-changer option for every industry and that’s why its demand in the market has increased rapidly. The world of 3D printing is just like a science fiction movie, where 3D prints have emerged as superheroes who save everyone. 3D printing is part of the additive manufacturing technology that works on the same principle that traditional inkjet printers do. 3D printings work with the combination of three things. It requires a top of life software and powder materials for creating 3D prints, whereas precision tools are also quite necessary in the process of three-dimensional printing. Modeling and slicing software is generally used in 3D printing just to guide the 3D printer for creating each 3D print perfectly.
We are adding here a detailed guide that will lead you towards the absolute functioning of a 3D printer.
The game of 3D printing starts with creating 3D modeling and to ensure it is successful one needs to have 3D modeling software. 3D printers usually work on manual instructions. You have to guide it on what actually to do for creating an absolute 3D printing. But doing that manually every time is not practical and that’s why 3D modeling software comes into existence.
You can make use of 3D printing for creating both simple and complex 3D prints. 3D modeling software is being designed to enable absolute precise designs quite conveniently. For example, if you are working in the industry of dentistry, you need to design and work on the teeth aligners that can precisely fit the individuals. Practically it is quite a hard thing to achieve but the absolute usage of 3D modeling software can make it a smooth run for you. 3D modeling software applications are also being widely used in the space industry for designing intricate parts of rocket ships.
Once you have successfully created your 3D model, the next thing you have to work on is slicing it. The 3D printer itself can’t conceptualize the concept of three dimensions and that’s why we need slicking software for slicing 3D models perfectly. The slicing software scans each layer of the 3D model precisely and commands the printer how to move in for recreating that layer perfectly. It’s only the slicing software that tells the 3D printers where a 3D model requires a fill and where it does. Fill is a quite important segment of every 3D printing process that provides internal lattices and columns to your 3D print and hence helps in maintaining its shape and strength. Slicing software perfectly slices the 3D models and then gives commands to the 3D printer for initiating the actual printing process.
The final game of 3D printing gets started up after the completion of the tasks being processed by 3D modeling software and the slicing software. 3D printers are just like a traditional inkjet printer with some additional features. If we talk about the simple and direct 3D printing process, the nozzle of the 3D printers moves back and forth which further dispenses a wax or plastic-like polymer in layer format. 3D printers rest in wait for some time until the previous layers get dried completely before adding the next ones. Hundred of 2D prints are being added upon each other with each layer and that further lead up one to the final three-dimensional objects.
3D printers have the capabilities of working with a wide range of materials. 3D printing is the best way to recreate the absolute 3D model of objects with the best abilities. The most common filament options being used by the 3D printers are:
ABS is an acronym being used for Acrylonitrile butadiene styrene. It is a plastic material that can be easily shaped and resized for creating different objects. The best thing about ABS is that it is quite hard to break on.
This type of filament option is most commonly used for creating strong and lightweight 3D prints. The carbon fiber filament is being designed by infusing the fragments of carbon fibers in a polymer base. One can easily use these filament options with different 3D printing materials such as PLA, ABS, PETG , nylon, and different others for creating more effective results.
The conductive filaments are designed to create 3D print electrically conductive components. These filament options are very important for wearable technology and are being used with PLA or ABS materials for creating low-voltage electronic circuits, buttons, raspberry Pi cases and power connectors, etc.
Being constructed from thermoplastic elastomers, this filament option is blendable and tough. The material is quite elastic and is being used for printing materials like bands of wristwatches and phone covers.
Metal filaments are often being created from finely ground metals and polymer glue. Bronze, aluminum, copper, brass, stainless steel are one of the most commonly used metal filament options in the market. The best thing about metal filaments is that they provide the looks and the feel of real metal to the users.
Wood filaments are usually being designed by combining a PLA-based material with absolutely fine ground wood powder. These filament options are used for printing wooden-looking objects.
The actual timing of the 3D printing process depends upon its complexity. One can easily make a 3D print of simpler materials such as a phone cover, box, or a ball mini chess, etc. in just a few hours, whereas it can take weeks or longer for creating complex 3D prints like a pedestal bridge, or a full-sized home. While going out for the 3D printing process, you need to consider the size, detail, and scope of the object you are working on.
Not every 3D printer available in the market works the same. Right from a simple inkjet printer to FDM printers, one can easily find a wide range of options there. There are some differences among all that also affect the printing process of the final 3D object. FDM printers i.e. Fused Deposition Modeling are one of the most common types of 3D printers. The best thing about these 3D printers is that they can be effectively used for prototyping plastic models quite fast.
If we talk about the speed of the 3D printers, printers featured with Stereolithography Technology i.e. SLA is supposed to provide fast prototyping with intricate details. These printer options usually use ultraviolet light for crafting 3D prints. DLP or Digital Light Processing printers are one of the oldest 3D printing formats available in the market today.
Costing of the 3D printers
The market is full of a wide range of 3D printer options. One can easily get a 3D printer for up to $200 whereas you may need to spend about $100,000 for getting the other. Features like size, specialty, and usage create a lot of differences between the different 3D printer options. The overall pricing of 3D printers has dropped to a greater extent in the last few years. It has become an important part of almost every industry. We will advise you to create a list of your preferences first, before heading towards the marketplace for the 3D printer. It will help you in getting the best option at affordable pricing. For more reliable results, going with the brand name is also beneficial.
3D printing technology has become an integral part of different industries. A 3D printer not only helps you in getting absolute products at affordable pricing but it is a great way to understand the complexity of different things in a better way. It is a part of a wide range of applications such as mass customization, cloud-based additive manufacturing, rapid prototyping, research, food, agile tooling, and much more. Working on a 3D printer is never so easy until you have absolute knowledge of it. We have tried to add on here the different aspects of 3D printing along with its absolute functioning so that you can get an idea of how important technology is and how it has eased up things for us.",source_text/9fe042363d7edfc95b35251906ae90bc71e7ae3b23d12fd4679de078df9f93d7-bing_chat_2_0.txt,"Once you have successfully created your 3D model, the next thing you have to work on is slicing it.

The parents may be of different species, genera, or (rarely) families. The term hybrid, therefore, has a wider application than the terms mongrel or crossbreed, which usually refer to animals or plants resulting from a cross between two races, breeds, strains, or varieties of the same species. There are many species hybrids in nature (in ducks, oaks, blackberries, etc.), and, although naturally occurring hybrids between two genera have been noted, most of these latter result from human intervention.
Because of basic biological incompatibilities, sterile hybrids (those incapable of producing living young) such as the mule (a hybrid between a jackass and a mare) commonly result from crosses between species. Some interspecific hybrids, however, are fertile and true breeding . These hybrids can be sources for the formation of new species. Many economically or aesthetically important cultivated plants (bananas, coffee, peanuts, dahlias, roses, bread wheats, alfalfa, etc.) have originated through natural hybridization or hybridization induced by chemical means, temperature changes, or irradiation.
The process of hybridization is important biologically because it increases the genetic variety (number of different gene combinations) within a species, which is necessary for evolution to occur. If climatic or habitat conditions change, individuals with certain combinations may be eliminated, but others with different combinations will survive. In this way, the appearance or behaviour of a species gradually may be altered. Such natural hybridization, which is widespread among certain species, makes the identification and enumeration of species very difficult.

chromosome , the microscopic threadlike part of the cell that carries hereditary information in the form of genes . A defining feature of any chromosome is its compactness. For instance, the 46 chromosomes found in human cells have a combined length of 200 nm (1 nm = 10 − 9 metre); if the chromosomes were to be unraveled, the genetic material they contain would measure roughly 2 metres (about 6.5 feet) in length. The compactness of chromosomes plays an important role in helping to organize genetic material during cell division and enabling it to fit inside structures such as the nucleus of a cell, the average diameter of which is about 5 to 10 μm (1 μm = 0.00l mm, or 0.000039 inch), or the polygonal head of a virus particle, which may be in the range of just 20 to 30 nm in diameter.
The structure and location of chromosomes are among the chief differences between viruses, prokaryotes , and eukaryotes . The nonliving viruses have chromosomes consisting of either DNA (deoxyribonucleic acid) or RNA (ribonucleic acid); this material is very tightly packed into the viral head. Among organisms with prokaryotic cells (i.e., bacteria and blue-green algae ), chromosomes consist entirely of DNA. The single chromosome of a prokaryotic cell is not enclosed within a nuclear membrane. Among eukaryotes, the chromosomes are contained in a membrane-bound cell nucleus. The chromosomes of a eukaryotic cell consist primarily of DNA attached to a protein core. They also contain RNA. The remainder of this article pertains to eukaryotic chromosomes.
Every eukaryotic species has a characteristic number of chromosomes ( chromosome number ). In species that reproduce asexually, the chromosome number is the same in all the cells of the organism. Among sexually reproducing organisms, the number of chromosomes in the body (somatic) cells is diploid (2 n ; a pair of each chromosome), twice the haploid (1 n ) number found in the sex cells, or gametes . The haploid number is produced during meiosis . During fertilization , two gametes combine to produce a zygote , a single cell with a diploid set of chromosomes. See also polyploidy .
Somatic cells reproduce by dividing, a process called mitosis . Between cell divisions the chromosomes exist in an uncoiled state, producing a diffuse mass of genetic material known as chromatin. The uncoiling of chromosomes enables DNA synthesis to begin. During this phase, DNA duplicates itself in preparation for cell division.
Following replication, the DNA condenses into chromosomes. At this point, each chromosome actually consists of a set of duplicate chromatids that are held together by the centromere . The centromere is the point of attachment of the kinetochore, a protein structure that is connected to the spindle fibres (part of a structure that pulls the chromatids to opposite ends of the cell). During the middle stage in cell division, the centromere duplicates, and the chromatid pair separates; each chromatid becomes a separate chromosome at this point. The cell divides, and both of the daughter cells have a complete (diploid) set of chromosomes. The chromosomes uncoil in the new cells, again forming the diffuse network of chromatin.
Among many organisms that have separate sexes, there are two basic types of chromosomes: sex chromosomes and autosomes . Autosomes control the inheritance of all the characteristics except the sex-linked ones, which are controlled by the sex chromosomes. Humans have 22 pairs of autosomes and one pair of sex chromosomes. All act in the same way during cell division. For information on sex-linked characteristics, see linkage group .
Chromosome breakage is the physical breakage of subunits of a chromosome. It is usually followed by reunion (frequently at a foreign site, resulting in a chromosome unlike the original). Breakage and reunion of homologous chromosomes during meiosis are the basis for the classical model of crossing over, which results in unexpected types of offspring of a mating.

Not all who wander are lost — this is one of the most famous lines from J.R.R. Tolkien’s The Lord of the Rings. Even if you’re not a fan of fantasy literature and movies, you have probably come across this quote many times. After all, it’s all over the Internet.
Clearly, many people can relate to the line and find some eye-opening truth behind it. Why else would they keep sharing and resharing it on their social media profiles, right? However, to uncover the real meaning of Tolkien’s words, you need to read between the lines.
In his quote, the English writer has hidden a special message for people who feel lost. So, today, I will take the time to decipher it. Hopefully, the true meaning of the quote will help those of you who currently feel hopeless and lost.
The line Not all who wander are lost is from Tolkien’s The Fellowship of the Ring . If you are not familiar with The Lord of the Rings book series, this is its first part.
In the novel, the line refers to a character called Aragorn. Although he is the heir of a king, he grows up without knowledge of his true heritage. Later, when Aragorn finally learns about his royal parentage, he decides to leave the peaceful town in which he lives. Then, he spends a long time wandering around the Wild.
By traveling, Aragorn hopes that he would gain the knowledge and experience he needs to be a good king. Fortunately, his plan works, and his kingdom turns into a prosperous land during his reign.
Nowadays, exploring foreign countries is faster, easier, and cheaper than ever before. As a result, more and more people are discovering the beauty and thrill of living as globetrotters. Their passion for traveling comes from their desire to lead a more fulfilling and exciting life.
However, such an unconventional lifestyle can raise quite a few eyebrows. So, a common perception of world travelers is that they are individuals who have no purpose in life.
That’s how The Lord of the Rings quote comes in the picture. For globetrotters, it captures the idea that surrendering to your wanderlust does not mean that you are lost. Furthermore, it suggests that a person’s desire to explore the world can be their life purpose.
While there’s something quite charming about travel aficionados’ interpretation of Tolkien’s words, the actual message behind the quote is different. As mentioned, the line targets not those who like to wander around the world, but those who feel lost.
If you take a close look at Tolkien’s body of work, you’ll see that he does not encourage aimless wandering. In fact, his characters are often wary of taking a journey into the unknown. To give you an example, here’s another quote from The Fellowship of the Ring:
“It’s a dangerous business going out of your door,” he [Bilbo Baggins] used to say. “You step into the Road, and if you don’t keep your feet, there is no knowing where you might be swept off to.”
While the English writer is not fond of taking his characters on pointless travels, he often “sends” them on quests. So, behind every journey in his books, there is always a purpose or a goal.
That’s also the case when it comes to the line Not all who wander are lost. Aragorn wanders around his kingdom not because he’s lost but because he wants to learn to be a successful monarch. That is his goal.
Therefore, the true meaning behind Tolkien’s famous line is that all who wander without an aim are lost. In contrast, those whose journey has an end goal have a real purpose in their life. Like Aragorn, they don’t feel lost even when they don’t know where they are going next.
Did you know that having dreams is crucial to your happiness? Researchers have found that working on our goals makes us feel happier and more satisfied with life. When you think about it, this theory makes sense because humans feel lost and unhappy in three different situations.
The first is when you have no goals, and you’re just floating through life like a leaf in the wind. Instead of working towards something, you go with the flow. So, you end up with nothing to look forward to and to anticipate.
The second case is when you have achieved your goals, but they have failed to meet your expectations. For example, you spent years trying to make someone fall in love with you. Then, when you finally get together with your crush, you realize you have little in common. As a result, you’re back to square one with no goals on your to-do list.
Finally, you can feel lost when you have a goal, but you don’t know how to achieve it. For instance, you want to live on a remote island, but you have no idea how you’ll support yourself there.
So, to feel lost is not something bad, after all. In reality, this feeling is wonderful because it shows that you’ve finally realized you need a change in your life. Otherwise, you will never be happy.
Deep down, you know you can accomplish greater things. All you need to do now is figure out what these things are and to find your life purpose.
If you want to “find” yourself again, you need to start actively searching for a new goal. In fact, looking for a goal is a goal in its own right! If you have a quest to complete, you’ll be like a Tolkien wanderer — you will wander with a purpose.
Eventually, you will realize who you want to be and what you want to achieve in life. Until then, embrace the way you feel today and use your negative emotions to fuel your journey ahead. Let them motivate you on your quest to find new dreams.
Tolkien’s quote Not all who wander are lost aims to remind you always to have goals to chase. Without them, you’ll just wander through life aimlessly.

Gas pain can be sharp or cramp-like and can be felt in the abdomen, chest, or back. It can be accompanied by bloating, burping, or flatulence.",Eating certain foods can increase gas production and cause pain.,"Gas in your digestive system is part of the normal process of digestion. Getting rid of excess gas, either by burping or passing gas (flatus), also is normal. Gas pain may occur if gas is trapped or not moving well through your digestive system.
An increase in gas or gas pain may result from eating foods that are more likely to produce gas. Often, relatively simple changes in eating habits can lessen bothersome gas.
Certain digestive system disorders, such as irritable bowel syndrome or celiac disease, may cause — in addition to other signs and symptoms — an increase in gas or gas pain.
Signs or symptoms of gas or gas pains include:
- Burping
- Passing gas
- Pain, cramps or a knotted feeling in your abdomen
- A feeling of fullness or pressure in your abdomen (bloating)
- An observable increase in the size of your abdomen (distention)
Burping is normal, particularly during or right after a meal. Most people pass gas up to 20 times a day. Therefore, while having gas may be inconvenient or embarrassing, burping and passing gas are rarely by themselves a sign of a medical problem.
Talk to your doctor if your gas or gas pains are so persistent or severe that they interfere with your ability to function well in daily life. Gas or gas pains accompanied by other signs or symptoms may indicate more-serious conditions. See your doctor if you experience any of these additional signs or symptoms:
- Bloody stools
- Change in consistency of stools
- Change in frequency of bowel movements
- Weight loss
- Constipation or diarrhea
- Persistent or recurrent nausea or vomiting
Seek immediate care if you experience:
- Prolonged abdominal pain
- Chest pain

Gas in your stomach is primarily caused by swallowing air when you eat or drink. Most stomach gas is released when you burp.
Gas forms in your large intestine (colon) when bacteria ferment carbohydrates — fiber, some starches and some sugars — that aren't digested in your small intestine. Bacteria also consume some of that gas, but the remaining gas is released when you pass gas from your anus.
Certain high-fiber foods may cause gas, including:
- Beans and peas (legumes)
- Fruits
- Vegetables
- Whole grains
While high-fiber foods increase gas production, fiber is essential for keeping your digestive tract in good working order and regulating blood sugar and cholesterol levels.
Other dietary factors that can contribute to increased gas in the digestive system include the following:
- Carbonated beverages, such as soda and beer, increase stomach gas.
- Eating habits, such as eating too quickly, drinking through a straw, chewing gum, sucking on candies or talking while chewing results in swallowing more air.
- Fiber supplements containing psyllium, such as Metamucil, may increase colon gas.
- Sugar substitutes, or artificial sweeteners, such as sorbitol, mannitol and xylitol, found in some sugar-free foods and beverages may cause excess colon gas.
Medical conditions that may increase intestinal gas, bloating or gas pain include the following:
- Chronic intestinal disease. Excess gas is often a symptom of chronic intestinal conditions, such as diverticulitis, ulcerative colitis or Crohn's disease.
- Small bowel bacterial overgrowth. An increase or change in the bacteria in the small intestine can cause excess gas, diarrhea and weight loss.
- Food intolerances. Gas or bloating may occur if your digestive system can't break down and absorb certain foods, such as the sugar in dairy products (lactose) or proteins such as gluten in wheat and other grains.
- Constipation. Constipation may make it difficult to pass gas.",source_text/d79835b7ed8aaefffa3bc3304a61796ff18a121ae19e6b1514487e8879e7f463-neeva_0_0.txt,An increase in gas or gas pain may result from eating foods that are more likely to produce gas.,complete_support,False,gas - funding - police - defunding - pain - eating - policing - increased - digestive - trapped,StanfordCitation,0.62,0.5433333333333333,0.53,0.48,[0.9912151098251343],[0.9912151098251343]

Patents also provide a decentralized system for encouraging innovation, as the government incentivizes the development of new drugs by offering a temporary monopoly. Patents and exclusivity work in a similar fashion but are distinct from one another and governed by different statutes. Patent terms are set by statute and currently last for 20 years from the date of filing in the United States. Exclusivity periods vary depending on the type of exclusivity, with Orphan Drug Exclusivity lasting 7 years and New Chemical Entity Exclusivity lasting 5 years.",Patents and exclusivity work in a similar fashion but are distinct from one another and governed by different statutes.,"Orange Book Frequently Asked Questions
1. What is the difference between patents and exclusivity?
Patents and exclusivity work in a similar fashion but are distinct from one another and governed by different statutes. Patents are a property right granted by the United States Patent and Trademark Office anytime during the development of a drug and can encompass a wide range of claims. Exclusivity refers to certain delays and prohibitions on approval of competitor drugs available under the statute that attach upon approval of a drug or of certain supplements. A new drug application (NDA) or abbreviated new drug application (ANDA) holder is eligible for exclusivity if statutory requirements are met. See 21 C.F.R. 314.108, 316.31, 316.34 and sections 505A, 505E, and 505(j)(5)(B)(iv) of the FD&C Act. Periods of exclusivity and patent terms may or may not run concurrently. Exclusivity was designed to promote a balance between new drug innovation and greater public access to drugs that result from generic drug competition.
2. How long is a patent term?
Patent terms are set by statute. Currently, the term of a new patent is 20 years from the date on which the application for the patent was filed in the United States. Many other factors can affect the duration of a patent.
3. How long does an exclusivity period last?
It depends on what type of exclusivity is at issue.
- Orphan Drug Exclusivity (ODE) – 7 years
- New Chemical Entity Exclusivity (NCE) – 5 years
- Generating Antibiotic Incentives Now (GAIN) Exclusivity– 5 years added to certain exclusivities
- New Clinical Investigation Exclusivity – 3 years
- Pediatric Exclusivity (PED) – 6 months added to existing Patents/Exclusivity
- Patent Challenge (PC) – 180 days (this exclusivity is for ANDAs only)
- Competitive Generic Therapy (CGT) - 180 days (this exclusivity is for ANDAs only)
See 21 C.F.R. 314.108, 316.31, 316.34 and sections 505A, 505E, 505(j)(5)(B)(iv), and Section 505(j)(5)(B)(v) of the FD&C Act.
4. Why does the exclusivity expire before the patent?
Patent before exclusivity?
Why does a particular drug product only have patents?
Only have exclusivity?
Have neither?
Patents and exclusivity apply to drugs in different ways. Patents can be issued or expire at any time regardless of the drug’s approval status. Exclusivity attaches upon approval of a drug product if the statutory requirements are met. Some drugs have both patent and exclusivity protection while others have just one or neither. Patents and exclusivity may or may not run concurrently and may or may not cover the same aspects of the drug product. Patents and exclusivities that have expired are removed from the Orange Book.
5. What information related to pediatric exclusivity is listed in the Orange Book?
When pediatric exclusivity is obtained, a 6-month period of exclusivity is added to all existing patents and exclusivity on all applications held by the sponsor for that active moiety. Pediatric exclusivity does not stand alone, but attaches to existing exclusivity. When pediatric exclusivity attaches, in the patent column of the Orange Book, the patent is shown twice—once with the original patent expiration date and a second time reflecting the six month period of pediatric exclusivity linked to that particular patent. Related information can be found on the web page Qualifying for Pediatric Exclusivity Under Section 505A of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act: Frequently Asked Questions on Pediatric Exclusivity (505A), The Pediatric ""Rule,"" and their Interaction
6. Where can I find patent and exclusivity regulations in the Code of Federal Regulations (C.F.R.)?

7. How is an NDA holder notified if their application has received a period of exclusivity?
No letters are sent to the application holder to indicate that a period of exclusivity has attached to their application. The posting of exclusivity information in the Orange Book is the official vehicle for dissemination of this information.
Back to Top
8. When should an NDA holder submit patent information?
Patent information is required to be submitted with all new drug applications (NDAs) and certain supplemental applications (sNDAs) on Form FDA 3542a at the time of submission of the NDA or sNDA. Patent information for listing in the Orange Book must be submitted on Form FDA 3542 within 30 days following approval of an NDA or supplemental application. For patents issued after approval of the NDA or supplement, the NDA holder must submit the required patent information within 30 days of the issuance of the patent for it to be considered timely filed. If the NDA holder timely submits the required patent information, but FDA notifies the NDA holder that its Form FDA 3542 is incomplete or shows that the patent is not eligible for listing, the NDA holder must submit an acceptable Form FDA 3542 within 15 days of FDA’s notification to be considered timely filed as of the date of the original submission of patent information. New patent information may still be submitted after 30 days of the issuance of the patent, but such information is not considered timely filed.
9. What is a patent submission date?
A patent submission date is the date on which the FDA receives patent information from the new drug application (NDA) holder. See 21 C.F.R. 314.53(d)(5).
10. Why doesn’t the Orange Book include patent submission dates for most records?
The FDA began patent submission date data collection in 2013. The October 2016 final rule “ Abbreviated New Drug Applications and 505(b)(2) Applications ” states, “FDA intends to list the date of submission of patents and patent information in the Orange Book on a prospective basis beginning as soon as is practicable after the effective date of this rule.” The Orange Book will now publish patent submission dates for all new records going forward.
11. How can an NDA holder request a patent submission date error correction?
NDA holders should email error correction requests, including justification for the request to:
orangebook@fda.hhs.gov .
Requests will be considered on a case by case basis and, if accurate, will be updated in the Orange Book as soon as is practicable.
12. How should an NDA holder correct or request removal of patent information?
An NDA holder must submit a correction or change to previously submitted patent information on a new Form FDA 3542. For changes to descriptions of approved methods of use, see question 14 .
If an NDA holder determines that a patent or patent claim no longer meets the requirements for listing, the NDA holder must promptly notify FDA to amend the patent information or withdraw the patent or patent information and request that the patent or patent information be removed from the list. The NDA holder seeking to withdraw a patent must submit to its NDA a statement containing the NDA number to which the request applies, each product(s) approved in the NDA to which the request applies, and the patent number, and identify the submission as “Time Sensitive Patent Information.” If the NDA holder is required by court order to amend patent information or withdraw a patent from the list, it must submit an amendment to its NDA that includes a copy of the order, within 14 days of the date the order was entered. In addition, the NDA holder must submit a correction to the expiration date of the patent on Form FDA 3542 within 30 days after the grant of patent term extension.
13. Should an NDA holder submit patent information when seeking approval of a supplement?
An NDA holder must submit patent information when it seeks approval of a supplement to add or change the dosage form or route of administration, to add or change the strength or to change the drug product from prescription use to over-the-counter use.
For supplements that seek approval for other changes (for example, to change the formulation, to add a new indication or other condition of use, or to make any other patented change regarding the drug substance, drug product, or any method of use), the requirements for submitting patent information depend on whether the existing patent information in the Orange Book for the original NDA continues to claim the changed product:
- If one or more patents, for which information was properly submitted for the product approved in the original NDA, claim the changed product, then the applicant is not required to resubmit this patent information, and FDA will continue to list the patent information.
- If one or more patents, for which information was properly submitted for the product approved in the original NDA, no longer claim the changed product, the applicant must submit a request to remove the listed patent information at the time of the approval of the supplement.
- If one or more patents, for which information was not previously submitted, claim the changed product, the applicant must submit the patent information required under 314.53(c).The NDA holder also must submit patent information for any supplement if the description of the patented method of use in the Orange Book would change upon approval of the supplement.
14. When may an NDA holder amend the description of the approved method(s) of use claimed by the patent?
An amendment to the description of approved method(s) of use claimed by the patent will be considered timely if it is submitted within 30 days of: (1) patent issuance, (2) approval of a corresponding change to product labeling, or (3) a decision by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office or a Federal court that is specific to the patent and alters the construction of a method-of-use claim(s) of the patent (and the amendment contains a copy of the decision). Outside of these circumstances and except as provided in the patent listing dispute regulation (21 CFR 314.53(f)(1)), an amendment to the description of the approved method(s) of use claimed by the patent will not be considered timely filed.
If the amendment to the description of the approved method(s) of use claimed by the patent is filed within an acceptable time frame but is incomplete or shows that the patent is not eligible for listing, the NDA holder must submit an acceptable Form FDA 3542 within 15 days of FDA’s notification to be considered timely filed as of the date of the submission of amended patent information.",source_text/30eb5b525eee2c8e34184d925e3d08676b8e6507c7c58563597ecad623a31f9d-neeva_2_1.txt,Patents are a property right granted by the United States Patent and Trademark Office anytime during the development of a drug and can encompass a wide range of claims.

Stainless steel is an appealing option for everything from accent work to kitchen appliances. It adds a modern twist to architecture and design features, but it also provides durability and functionality to tools and utensils, especially in the food and automotive industries.
It’s not easy to find a material that looks better than stainless steel when it’s polished to a mirror shine. That shimmering, high-gloss look isn’t the only reason people choose stainless steel for everything from refrigerators to auto parts. Many people appreciate that it’s a generally maintenance-free material and happily pay more for the aesthetic appeal.
Stainless steel holds up well against corrosion, high heat, and most chemicals, making it an ideal choice for industrial, commercial, hobby, or residential use. Unfortunately, even though stainless steel is tough, it can still age. You may notice scratches or a dull cast to the pieces over time.
You don’t have to suffer with less than shiny stainless steel, though. While stainless steel is one of the toughest metals to polish, it’s possible to get your items back to their original shine. It doesn’t matter how large or small your project is, you only need to know one basic three-step process for buffing and polishing stainless steel.
How to polish stainless steel in three simple steps:
1. Clean and prep the stainless steel
2. Buff the stainless steel
3. Polish the stainless steel
The first place to start with any corrective project is cleaning the surface. Any leftover debris or residue can make scratches worse, so it’s best to start with a clean slate when learning how to polish stainless steel.
Use a mild detergent, like dish soap, and a clean sponge to gently clean the surface. Make sure you remove any sticky spots, even if you have to use a soft-bristled brush to clear the gunk off. Do not use steel wool or anything that could damage the stainless steel further.
Rinse the soap off with clean water and dry it with a clean towel. Note that smudges do not matter at this point, you will address those later.
Pieces with significant mottling or rough edges may need to do some additional prep work before moving on to buffing. Some people like to do an initial once-over with something in the 80 to 120 grit range, especially if you did some welding on the piece or have significant surface damage and gouges. It’s a way to level the surface for a better finish.
Make sure that you clean the piece again before moving on to the next step. Any contaminants left behind could interfere with the final product.
Once you have a clean, dry surface, it’s time to pull out the tools and get to work. The buffing or sanding stage may not be the most fun, but it’s necessary to restore that mirror shine you want.
Buffing stainless steel is a gradual process that may require a little trial and error on your part. You may be able to handle smaller or narrower pieces by hand, but using a power sander is likely your best bet for achieving an even result.
Start buffing stainless steel with sandpaper between 150 and 240 grit. Many pros suggest going from 240 up to 400, then 600, and finally 1200 grit to round out your progression. You could take things a step further with a 2000 grit sandpaper , but it’s probably only helpful or necessary for a mirror finish.
Set your sander between 4,000 and 6,500 RPM for buffing stainless steel. Be careful to move the sander at a 90° angle to any noticeable scratches. Every time you swap out the sandpaper to a different grit, move 90° from the previous motion.
When you get the stainless steel piece to an even, satiny finish, it’s time to move on. Note that you want to remove any imperfections before moving to the polishing phase to get optimal results.
If you truly want your piece to shimmer, so clear you can practically see your reflection, then buffing is a necessary step. Especially with food and kitchen items, it can be tempting to take the easy route and just use olive oil or something similar to do a quick polish and call it a day. Unfortunately, that method won’t last, and it won’t correct any scratches.
Consider this: you have a dull, scratched piece of stainless steel. You apply oil or polish by hand that fills in the cracks, including the microscopic ones. That polish wears down quickly, debris gets caught in the crevices, and it takes no time for every scratch to stand out like a sore thumb. Plus, the light reflects strangely off the surface giving it a dull appearance.
Buffing stainless steel allows you to smooth out those scratches and imperfections so that debris can’t collect in the microscopic crevices. The multi-step process slowly smooths imperfections and restores the metal’s best qualities.
Even though buffing is time-consuming, it’s the only way to repair the surface and give you that aesthetically pleasing and durable mirror finish you desire.
Depending on the piece, you may not want to spend too much time refining the finish.
A matte finish is like a basic repair. It works for pieces that don’t need to be shiny or attractive but require some work to repair pitting and gouges. Basically, a matte finish is the step before everything looks shiny and new. You can usually get to the matte level with one or two buffing levels, like a 240 grit and then 300 or 400 grit.
A brushed finish is generated with 150 to 240 coated abrasive belts or drums or medium very fine nonwoven abrasives.
A matte or satin finish is generated with a 220 to 240 grit coated abrasive or very fine nonwoven abrasive belt, drum, or disc.
At this point, if you are looking to create a brushed finish, you need to be mindful of the direction you are sanding. If you want a brushed/satin finish with the grain all going in one direction, it is best to use a grinding belt or abrasive drum to set the grain pattern.
The brushed finish is quite common, especially for kitchens and spaces that see a lot of light. Since we don’t love being blinded by our appliances, a brushed finish offers all the shine without the reflection. Unfortunately, it may leave your piece with a little less corrosion resistance, so you may need to apply a rust-proofing finish.
The mirror finish is aesthetically pleasing and masks imperfections from other repairs, like welding. It makes stainless steel extremely shiny and easy to clean. However, that extra shiny finish takes time and effort.
After you finish the buffing process above, prepare to do a few more steps to complete the process. Cut buffing and color buffing use different tools and abrasive compounds to refine the stainless steel further. Note that the more you refine your piece during the initial buffing stages, the less cut buffing you need to do at this phase.
Cut buffing uses a black stainless steel buffing compound that contains an abrasive mineral. The compound removes the extremely fine scratches that you might not notice with your naked eye. We recommend using the blue airway buffing wheel for best results.
Switch gears slightly to a less coarse abrasive. Grab a fresh yellow airway buffing wheel and some brown tripoli compound . Shifting to the brown buffing compound will improve the color to give you a better finish.
Color buffing rounds out the process by pulling out the stainless steel’s brilliance to achieve that mirror-like aesthetic. Using a green rouge compound with a fresh untreated white airway buff should get you a nice, glossy surface.
Take a step back and admire your, almost, reflection in your mirror finished stainless steel.
For your convenience, we have combined all of the products just mentioned into a complete stainless steel buffing kit set.
Buffing is the most important step in polishing stainless steel to a fine mirror finish. It’s important to take your time and work steadily.
- Be careful not to overdo it when applying the compound to the buffing wheel at each stage.
- Use a gentle hand when color buffing. You do not need to apply much pressure because you’re just finishing the piece off. Use a low speed to prevent an orange peel effect. If you happen to go too heavy with the green rouge compound, simply repeat the process with less pressure and a slower speed.
- Keep tight lines and work them as close together as possible. Try to avoid overlapping too much so that you get an even finish.
- Move quickly over the piece. Be careful not to linger for more than a second or two.
- Have plenty of clean cloths and buffing wheels on hand so that you can swap out every time you change compounds. Avoiding cross-contamination is extremely important, especially when using different abrasives.
Make sure that you always move with the grain and routinely check the piece over for scratches or imperfections before moving on to the next step. While you can revert to an early step at any time, it’s easier and more efficient to check your work as you go.
Polishing stainless steel requires less elbow grease, but possibly a little more finesse. It’s also the highlight of your project because you get to see actual results.
Maybe you used power tools to buff the piece but now you’d like to get down and dirty with the polish and your own two hands. It may even be the best option for smaller pieces that won’t take long.
Carefully clear away any excess compound or debris left behind during the buffing process. You should get a nice sheen with a commercial polish and a clean, dry cloth. Start at one edge and work across the surface in circles, like waxing a car.
When you finish, make sure you wipe away any excess polish with a clean, dry towel.
Whether you have a larger project or you want an even finish, polishing your piece with a buffing wheel might be your best bet. Knowing how to polish stainless steel with a machine might be more efficient, with a more even result and a shinier outcome.

Active tags provide a much longer read range than passive tags, but they are also much more expensive.","Active tags provide a much longer read range than passive tags, but they are also much more expensive.","For decades, asset-heavy businesses have used radio-frequency identification (RFID) in the form of tags and labels to monitor and track their assets, yet the indecisiveness of choosing either an active RFID tag or a passive RFID tag has remained.
With a global market share estimated to be worth $36.3 billion , businesses are recognising the importance of digitising their asset tracking processes. This has lead to a surge in the implementation of tracking technology and systems, such as an RFID tracking system.
As automated cloud-based tools like Asset Tracking Software become more accessible and affordable, asset-heavy organisations are reaping the benefits associated with tracking all forms of physical assets. Benefits such as building accurate asset registers, reducing replacements costs, and improving inventory management.
Among popular tracking technologies like GPS , NFC , Barcode, and QR Code , RFID is a system that can be traced back to the Second World War where it was used to identify and track enemy aircraft. Over the next 80 years, RFID technology evolved and became a main feature in the way businesses track, monitor, and manage their assets by using passive RFID and active RFID tags.
Today, RFID systems are used in multiple industries and processes including logistics, education, supply chain management, and manufacturing. One industry that has thrived using RFID tracking tools is retail . American retailer Walmart spent $500 million implementing an RFID system in 2004. While UK clothes retailer River Island increased their stock accuracy from 70% to 98% by deploying active and passive tags across stores and warehouses.
One advantage that RFID has over other tracking systems is the use of different types of tags. Each tag, whether passive RFID or active RFID, has various attributes that make either one ideal for different scenarios.

Although each RFID system can differ depending on the use of a passive or active tag, the required equipment remains the same; a tag, an antenna, a scanner/reader, and a digital database. Once in place, the process of tracking assets with RFID is broken down into four stages:
- Data is stored on a tag and attached to an asset
- An antenna identifies the signal of a nearby tag (passive or active)
- A reader connects to the antenna and receives the data stored on a tag
- The reader transmits the data to a database
A key variable that is interchangeable in this process is the tag. The two main types of tags to choose from are passive RFID tags and active RFID tags. Each tag offers its own unique capabilities when it comes to storing data and interacting with readers.
A passive RFID tag is a batteryless tag typically used in smaller-scale operations and tracking systems. Because a passive tag has no internal power source, it is instead powered by the energy transmitted from an RFID scanner. When compared side-by-side with their counterparts, passive RFID tags are generally a more utilised tag for businesses that have a large inventory of physical assets. This is due to their inexpensive cost and potential for a longer operational life.
Key points to remember regarding passive RFID tags include:
- They have no internal power source and are powered by a reader
- They have a lower signal range than active RFID tags
- Each one has a longer life expectancy than active RFID tags
- They are an inexpensive option starting at an average price of $0.08 per tag
Whereas a passive tag has no internal power source, an active RFID tag comes equipped with its own battery and internal transmitter in the form of a beacon or transponder. This means that an active tag is able to continuously transmit signals to an RFID reader up to 150 metres away, depending on frequency levels. This makes the use of an active RFID tag popular among businesses wanting to track assets in real-time and build an accurate real-time location system (RTLS).
Key points to remember regarding active RFID tags include:
- They’re battery-powered tags that continuously transmit signals
- They are commonly used to transmit data in real-time
- Each one has a signal range of up to 150 meters
- They’re more expensive than passive RFID tags
When implementing an active RFID system to track assets, businesses require a reader, an active tag, and an antenna. Unlike a passive tag, which has no internal power source, an active RFID tag will feature a long-lasting battery. This allows it to continuously send signals and transmit data stored on a tag.
Active tags are more than likely to operate with an ultra-high frequency between 433MHz and 960MHz. This allows them to transmit data at a greater range and provide users with the ability to read data stored on a tag from up to 150 metres away. This makes an active RFID system a perfect choice for processes such as:
- Vehicle tolling
- Real-time location tracking
- Inventory management
- Asset management
As with most equipment, there are variations of active tags that are suited for multiple business tasks. An active tag can be either a transponder or a beacon, the latter sending data continuously every 3-5 seconds and the former taking a more efficient approach by sending data only when a reader is in range to conserve battery life.
As well as this, active RFID systems also operate on various frequency levels. Lower frequencies providing more penetrating signals that are best used with materials such as water and metals.
- Long data read ranges of up to 150 metres
- Significant data memory and storage capacity
- Advanced data capabilities
- Rugged and weather-proof active labels
- More expensive than passive RFID tags
- Tags will need replacing when battery life ends
A passive RFID system consists of a reader, an antenna, and a passive tag. As the tag has no battery or power source, it consists of two components: an antenna and a microchip or integrated circuit (IC).
Instead of continuously sending data like an active RFID tag, passive tags will sit idle and wait until they receive a signal from a reader. With no power source, a passive tag’s energy is drawn from the radio-frequency waves that originate from a reader. These waves wake the tag’s IC and generate a signal back to the RFID system. This is also known as backscatter.
Similar to active tags, there are multiple variations of a passive RFID tag. Two of the most common types are called inlays and hard tags. Inlays provide the cheapest option for an RFID system and are typically attached to assets with adhesive. Whereas hard passive tags are rugged and made from materials such as plastic and metal. This makes hard tags essential for businesses with assets that operate in:
- High temperatures
- Adverse weather conditions
- Outdoor environments
As with active tags, passive RFID tags also work at various frequencies, too. Each frequency offers different read ranges, attachment options, and capabilities.
- More affordable than active tags
- Have a long life expectancy
- Offer a vast range of tag options
- Small and lightweight
- Have a low signal range of up to 5 metres
- Require a reader to power the tag’s microchip/IC
Sitting directly between active and passive tags are semi-passive RFID tags. A semi-passive tag behaves exactly as a middle option should, by offering a mix of features taken from the capabilities of both active and passive tags. Semi-passive RFID tags feature:
- An internal battery as well as an antenna and microchip/IC
- A low signal range when compared to an active RFID tag
- Cheaper pricing than active tags
- Real-time tracking and sensor capabilities
- Shorter read ranges than active tags but longer read ranges than passive tags
Like an active RFID tag, a semi-passive tag has an internal power source in the shape of a battery. Typically small and eco-friendly, a semi-passive tag’s battery is used to improve data transmission and read ranges. Making them an ideal and cheap solution for using RFID tracking systems for environment and condition monitoring such as temperature-controlled transit.

Microorganisms can produce different types of volatile compounds that may give characteristics smell, pleasant scent, or pungent odor. The production of these volatile chemicals depends on that particular organism’s metabolic factors.
When anaerobic bacteria like Clostridium decompose organic matters (mainly proteins), various foul-smelling, incompletely oxidized odoriferous compounds like H2S, methyl mercaptan, cadaverine, putrescine, and ammonia. Cadaverine and putrescine smell like rotting flesh, whereas methyl mercaptan smells like rotten cabbage.
Sometimes odor produced by these microorganisms may give essential clues in the identification of microorganisms. For example, foul-smelling diarrhea and the absence of blood or mucus in the stool distinguish giardiasis from bacterial or viral diarrhea.
You may have seen a technician trying to “smell the difference” between bacterial cultures. Though some laboratory personnel regard sniffing as a helpful tool, others regard it as a biohazard (1).
I suggest you be cautious while sniffing culture plates. Sniffing culture plates is not a good idea and you may contract a disease (2) .

Microorganisms do not have odor on their own, but they may produce various metabolites that have distinguished smells of their own. For example, spoiled seafood’s odor is primarily due to trimethylamine oxide (TMAO) produced by the action of bacteria. The earthy odor of soil is caused by the production of a series of complex metabolites called geosmin by Streptomycetes. Many cyanobacteria are also responsible for the production of earthy odors and flavors in some freshwater.
Some of the characteristics smell produced by microorganisms is tabulated here;
|Microbe||Odor|
|Alkaligenes faecalis||Freshly cut apples|
|Candida spp.||Yeast|
|Citrobacter spp.||Dirty sneakers|
|Clostridium difficile||Putrid, fecal|
|Corynebacterium spp.||Fruity|
|Eikenella corrodens||Bleach or cracker|
|Haemophilus spp.||Wet fur|
|Nocardia spp.||Musty basement|
|Pasteurella multocida||Pungent (indole)|
|Peptostreptococcus anaerobius||Fecal|
|Pigmented Bacteroides group||Acrid|
|Proteus spp.||Burnt chocolate|
|Pseudomonas aeruginosa||Fruity, grape-like|
|Staphylococcus spp.||Dirty sneakers|
|Certain viridans group Streptococcus spp.||Butter/butterscotch|
|Streptomyces spp.||Musty basement|
Anaerobes are particularly pungent due to their reliance on sulfhydryl compounds to maintain redox balance. When an anaerobic infection is suspected, the specimen is often foul-smelling. Gram-negative anaerobes are often responsible for ‘morning breath.’
Anaerobic bacteria produce fatty acids and other odoriferous compounds while decomposing organic matters (putrefaction). Major such compounds are hydrogen sulfide (H2S), methyl mercaptan (from sulfur amino acids), cadaverine (from lysine), putrescine (from ornithine), and ammonia. H2s smell like rotten eggs at low concentration levels in the air. Cadaverine and putrescine smell like rotting flesh, methyl mercaptan smells like rotten cabbage, and ammonia has a strong odor that smells like urine or sweat.
Bacterioides fragilis : Pus containing Bacteroides species has a very unpleasant smell.
Under anaerobic conditions, Clostridium perfringens multiplies and produces alpha-toxin and other toxins, resulting in the rapid destruction of tissue carbohydrates with the production of gas in decaying tissues, particularly muscle. The affected tissue is foul-smelling.
The colonies of Candida albicans have a distinctive yeast smell.
Certain cyanobacteria and actinomycetes synthesize geosmin, a volatile chemical reminiscent of potting soil.
Proteus mirabilis produces a very distinct fishy odor. On Salmonella-Shigella (SS) agar, Proteus usually smells like “rotten cooked fish.”
Pseudomonas aeruginosa produces a sweet grape-like scent, so wound dressings and agar plates are often sniffed for organism identification. Pseudomonas aeruginosa can famously generate a “grape juice” smell in infected burn patients (3). Cultures of Pseudomonas have a distinctive smell due to the production of 2-aminoacetophenone.
Woman infected with Gardnerella complaints of a grey, offensive, fishy ammoniacal smell. The fishy ammoniacal smell becomes more intense after adding a few drops of 10% potassium hydroxide. Burkholderia pseudomallei cultures also give off an ammoniacal odor.
Eikenella corrodens, a gram-negative rod responsible for wound infections, gives a bleach-like odor when grown in Blood Agar or Chocolate Agar .
Streptococcus milleri produces diacetyl (caramel odor). The detection of diacetyl (caramel odor) can be used in the presumptive identification of the “ Streptococcus milleri ” group (4).

The novel opens a few hundred years after this holocaust, with monstrous humans (some with two heads) loping around in the desert scrounging for food, and a colony of semi-literate Catholic monks trying to preserve civilization by hand-copying the few texts that survived the conflagration. But while the monks revere the scientific knowledge of the past, they remain wary of all technology. Their version of Vespers explicitly asks for protection from the radioactive elements that once rained down from the sky. And the first element they ask to be saved from is not uranium, plutonium, or hydrogen but another. ""From the rain of the cobalt,"" the monks pray, ""O Lord, deliver us.""
Cobalt emerged as a terror during the Cold War (Walter Miller wrote A Canticle for Leibowitz in 1960) because it makes the dirtiest dirty bomb imaginable. ""Conventional"" nuclear warheads do much of their damage by incinerating people and flattening buildings. Dirty bombs kill almost entirely by radioactivity. The radioactivity from conventional warheads certainly kills, too, but there the radioactive fallout isn't as dangerous overall as in a dirty bomb. Conventional warheads rain down some elements that fire off their radioactivity quickly, depleting their ammunition. Other elements from warheads cling to their radioactive particles for thousands of years. But even though they continue to release radioactivity for a long time, they emit at such low levels that you're not in acute danger. You can wait out the worst of it in a fallout shelter.

Cobalt hits a sweet spot—it fires off just enough radioactivity upfront to kill you (or at least cause serious cancers), but holds onto enough reserves to make wherever the cobalt rain settles inhospitable for future generations, too. Calculations made in 1950 hinted that sprinkling one-tenth of an ounce of cobalt-60 on every square mile of earth (admittedly, a lot of cobalt overall) would wipe out the human race, a nuclear version of the cloud that killed the dinosaurs.
Salting the soil like this would not take genius-level engineering. Normal cobalt is cobalt-59. That means it has 59 neutrons plus protons, one neutron short of being deadly. Uranium warheads produce loads of neutrons, and merely surrounding a uranium warhead with a jacket of cobalt-59 would create plenty of cobalt-60. No government (as far as we know) has ever tried to make such a bomb—and some scientists suspect it wouldn't work as well as it's supposed to—but the idea does have a way of sticking in the imagination. That's why the monks prayed for deliverance from Element 27. It's also why, in Dr. Strangelove , the Soviet enemies have cobalt bombs.
Unfortunately, scientists are still working hard to create new types of bombs that exploit new elements—and some may turn out to be even worse, both militarily and politically, than the dreaded cobalt.

Full trial expected later this year following decision by court after four-month dispute involving Sun on Sunday
The supreme court has extended the interim privacy injunction preventing identification of a celebrity who has been involved in a three-way sexual encounter.
The case has escalated into a public battle over the issue of whether or not injunctions banning publication can be sustained in the era of the internet, when websites beyond national jurisdictions can be read in the UK.
The decision by the country’s highest court follows a four-month legal dispute involving the Sun on Sunday. A full trial of the issue is expected later this year.
The claimant, known in court only as PJS and whose identity will continue to be disguised at least until then, is said to have had an extramarital affair with another couple about four years ago.
The couple approached the Sun on Sunday in January this year and told reporters about the relationship. The paper, which planned to publish the story, contacted PJS’s lawyers, initiating the courtroom dispute.
Delivering the court’s judgment by a four-to-one majority, Lord Mance said there was no public interest in naming PJS and that revealing details of the affair would breach the family’s privacy.
“Publication of the story would infringe privacy rights of PJS, his partner and their children,” he said. “… There is no public interest, however much it may be of interest to some members of the public, in publishing kiss-and-tell stories or criticisms of private sexual conduct, simply because the persons involved are well-known; and so there is no right to invade privacy by publishing them.
“It is different if the story has some bearing on the performance of a public office or the correction of a misleading public impression cultivated by the person involved. But … that does not apply here.”
The Independent Press Standards Code, to which the Sun on Sunday subscribes, Mance noted, requires editors to demonstrate an exceptional public interest to override the “normally paramount interests of the children”.
Referring to the fact that many of the details had already been published online, Mance added: “It is true the story has been accessible on the internet and social media but if the injunction were to be lifted, there would be intensive coverage of the story by the Sun on Sunday – and there is little doubt, by other newspapers – as well as unrestricted internet and social media coverage, all of which could constitute additional and potentially more enduring invasions of the privacy of PJS, his partner and their children.”
The supreme court justices said that in their balancing exercise – weighing up the conflicting interests of article 10 of the European convention on human rights, guaranteeing freedom of expression, and article 8, guaranteeing privacy – they believed that at any full trial of the issue the injunction would be likely to be upheld.
The high court refused the application for an injunction but, on appeal, the court of appeal granted PJS an interim injunction. Subsequently, a magazine in the US published the story, naming the parties involved.
Several other publications in the US, Canada and Scotland picked up the story, and details appeared on numerous websites. Newspapers in England published stories based on the redacted court of appeal judgment.
News Group Newspapers applied to have the injunction set aside on the basis that the protected information had entered the public domain. The court of appeal granted their application.
Desmond Browne QC, representing PJS, had earlier told the supreme court: “This case has been hailed by some as the deathknell of the privacy injunction. We hope that reports of its death have been greatly exaggerated.” Naming the celebrity would be devastating for the family’s children, Browne warned.
In the judgment on Thursday, Mance added: “Some may still question whether the case merits the weight of legal attention which it has received. But the law is there to protect the legitimate interests of those whose conduct may appear unappealing, as well as of children with no responsibility for such conduct.”
The court’s refusal to lift the injunction has been pilloried by some papers. Mance noted the onslaught: “The court is well aware of the lesson which King Canute gave his courtiers,” he said.
“Unlike Canute, the courts can take steps to enforce its injunction pending trial. As to the Mail online’s portrayal of the law as an ass, if that is the price of applying the law, it is one which must be paid … It is unlikely that the heavens will fall at our decision.
“It will simply give the appellant, his partner and their young children a measure of temporary protection against further and repeated invasions of privacy pending a full trial which will not have been rendered substantially irrelevant by disclosure of relatively ancient sexual history.”
The one dissenting judgment came from Lord Toulson, an expert on the law of confidentiality. He disputed whether allowing PJS to be named would prevent him pursing a subsequent civil trial for damages against the newspaper.
“I do not agree the trial would be rendered irrelevant,” he said in his judgment. “I would not rule out the possibility of the courts considering [an exemplary] award to be necessary and proportionate in order to deter flagrant breaches of privacy and provide adequate protection for the person concerned.”
He added: “The story is not going to go away, injunction or no injunction … [The children] are very young and there are various steps which their parents can take to shield them from immediate publicity … It is inevitable in the longer term that the children will learn about these matters and their parents have no doubt already considered how they propose to handle it.”
Toulson also noted: “Once it has become readily available to anyone who wants to know it, it has lost the essence of confidentiality. The court must live in the world as it is and not as it would like it to be.”
Victoria Newton, editor of the Sun on Sunday, said that her paper was disappointed by the court’s decision. “We have maintained throughout that the story was legitimate public interest journalism.
“Today’s ruling ignores that this is a story that has been printed around the world and published on blogs and social media easily accessible in this country and we echo the dissenting Judge Lord Toulson’s opinion that ‘the court must live in the world as it is and not as it would like it to be’.
“The Sun on Sunday will continue to fight to publish stories that we believe the public should know and the stories which people have a right to tell.”
The paper has the right to appeal against the decision and it is understood it is considering its position in consultation with lawyers.
Insiders fear the judgment could herald the end of kiss and tells in Fleet Street. The judges “are deluded when it comes to the internet”, one source said. “They live in the dark ages if they think the internet hasn’t changed things. This ruling doesn’t advance the issue any further than the Leveson inquiry which had a single paragraph on the internet. Maybe they think it’s a one-hit wonder and it will disappear.”
The judges ruled that exposure of someone’s sexual life was at the lower end of the spectrum of importance in relation to freedom of expression. The decision is being assessed by all newspaper groups and by any celebrities planning to seek an injunction against publishers.
Media lawyer Mark Stephens said the case could be the most significant since the infamous 1986 Spycatcher case when the government attempted to stop the media reporting allegations of misconduct in MI5 in the memoirs of a retired secret service employee.
“It’s the judgment I expected them to make, but ultimately we need to revisit this area since the last time this was looked at was the Spycatcher case,” said Stephens. He said the same issues about porous information borders were at play.
“Then, the House of Lords said an injunction was an exercise in futility as the book was published in Australia and newspapers were bringing copies into the country in suitcases and filming it to expose the weakness in the government’s attempt to ban the book.”
Peter Wright’s book was banned in the UK and the House of Lords overturned the government injunction blocking the Guardian and Observer reporting its contents.
Reputational management lawyer Michael Patrick said the supreme court had made clear it would not be “bullied by the media” but said “it will be a brave celebrity that seeks privacy injunctions in the future”.
Patrick said legal action provided limited protection in the era of the internet. “An injunction granted by the English courts will never eliminate the risk of the story being published elsewhere.”
A couple approach the Sun on Sunday with details of their relationship with a “well-known” married individual, subsequently referred to in a legal judgment by the initials PJS.
The paper contacts the entertainer’s lawyers, initiating a courtroom dispute as he seeks to prevent reporting about his alleged extramarital affair.
Lawyers for PJS and his partner, referred to as YMA, apply for a ban on publication. They fail to persuade a high court judge but are granted an interim injunction allowing them to appeal against the decision to the higher court.
In an anonymised judgment , the court of appeal rules that the Sun on Sunday cannot publish the story because PJS, who has an “open relationship”, had an expectation that his sexual encounters would remain private.
A Scottish newspaper prints the identities of the couple who took the injunction stating that it is doing so in order to champion free speech and a free press. It comes after details of the story are published in a US newspaper.
It emerges that Google has removed links to articles about the celebrity couple at the centre of the injunction in response to legal requests. Separately, an international edition of a newspaper distributed in England names a blog that has published the couple’s identity.
The Guardian and other media organisations win the right to report on the appeal hearing, which has raised the issue of whether injunctions restricting reporting can be enforced in the era of the internet. Judges delay their decision on whether to lift the injunction.
News Group Newspapers , publishers of the Sun and its sister Sunday title, win an application to have the injunction lifted, after telling the court earlier that the celebrity had already been named so widely online and in publications in the US and Scotland that the injunction was effectively redundant and unenforceable.
The injunction banning the media naming the celebrity involved in an extra-marital affair is extended for another two days by the supreme court. Lawyers for PJS succeed in having their claim fast-tracked to the supreme court in Westminster, which decides the case is important enough to have a hearing later in the week.
Desmond Browne QC, representing PJS, tells the bench of five justices at the supreme court that identifying a celebrity would be giving in to “the rule of the press”. Gavin Millar QC, for News Groups Newspapers, disputes that his clients had been solely responsible for provoking debate about the privacy case.
The supreme court posts a statement on its website announcing that it will deliver its long-awaited decision on the privacy injunction on 19 May.
The supreme court rules that the interim injunction will not be lifted.

Other popular destinations include Spain, the UK, and Italy, as well as Barcelona, the Swiss Alps, Cyprus, and the Lake Como.","France is the most popular country in Europe, with over 60 million visitors since 1995 according to.","World citizens are now travelling more than ever. The latest data published by the United Nations World Tourism Organization (UNWTO) show that international tourist arrivals grew 6% in 2018, totalling 1.4 billion, which was forecasted to be reached only in 2020.
In Europe alone were registered 710 million international tourist arrivals or about half of the total number. Southern and Mediterranean Europe drove the growth; however, the Western and Central European countries remain not only the most visited in Europe but also the top tourism destinations in the world.
Following, find the top ten most visited countries in Europe and the reasons why these countries are a magnet for tourists.
The world’s most visited country, France, is not all about the Eifel Tower, museums and wine. For more than a decade now, the country has lured the highest number of visitors, more than any other European or world country. The reasons for that are not few. The country has such a variety of tourism attractions that a year would not be enough to see and experience everything that it has to offer.
France is well known for the numerous splendid and enormous palaces, castles and cathedrals all across the country. The Palace of Versailles, the Castle of Chambord and the Notre-Dame Cathedral are some of the most famous.
Medieval villages like the Pérouges, St-Émilion, St-Jean Pied de Port, coastal villages, snowy mountains, beautiful beaches and enormous outdoor markets have made every traveller place France on their must-see list. Over 89 million visitors alone visited the country in 2018, and the numbers are believed to be much higher in 2019. France seems to be the top world destination since 1995 when the country received over 60 million visitors.
Mostly located on the Iberian Peninsula, Spain is the second most visited country in Europe. Around 82.7 million travellers stepped into Spain in 2018 alone, 1 million more than in the previous year.
Spain has 47 UNESCO world heritage sites, numerous beaches on the Atlantic and Mediterranean, and numerous festivals that bring together people from all across the world. Many have compared the coastal part of Spain with tropical islands.
The variety of foods, in particular the Tortilla Espanola, Pisto, Paella, Paella and other traditional foods have added the value of a trip to Spain.
Its football teams are among the most famous in the world. It is estimated that the Copa Del Rey championship attracts thousands of visitors yearly.
Home to some of the most famous buildings in the world, like the Colosseum and the Leaning Tower of Pisa, Italy is the third most visited country in the old continent of Europe. A number of 52.4 million visitors entered the country in 2016, 58.3 million in 2017 and 62.1 million in 20218.
Home to numerous castles, palaces, cathedrals, vineyards and beaches, the country is also known for its influential art, architecture and culture. The Vatican Museums located in the heart of Rome are another attraction for many. Rome itself is the third most visited city in Europe, after Paris and London. Florence, Venice, Milan and Naples are among the most visited cities in Italy.
And even though Italian cuisine is spread worldwide, eating pasta and pizza in Italy, is a must-do for many.
Istanbul is probably the dream of every traveller. The meeting point of the occidental and oriental cultures, Istanbul was established in 660 BCE and was known as Constantinople before the Ottomans conquered the city.
No traveller to Turkey will skip Istanbul. The city has a unique mixture of Byzantine and Ottoman architecture, tasty middle eastern food, nice weather, and lots of friendly cats and dogs freely wandering across the city.
Turkey received 45.7 million in 2018, while in 2017 it counted a total of 37.6 million tourists. Travellers interested in history in particular visit the ancient Greek city of Ephesus, the Cappadocia rock valleys, the pure white travertine terraces of Pamukkale, and the ruins of the former Armenian capital Ani and much more.
A huge share of the total number of annual tourists travelling to Turkey goes there to spend their vacations in one of the numerous luxury hotels which you can find in most of the bigger cities.
One of the strongest economies in the world has a very strong tourism industry as well. A good share of the German budget comes from tourism. Visitors hardly travel across Europe without stopping in Germany. In 2018, Germany had 38.8 million tourists, while in 2017, 37.5 million visitors entered the country.
It shares borders with Denmark to the north, Poland and the Czech Republic to the east, Austria and Switzerland to the south, France to the southwest, and Luxembourg, Belgium and the Netherlands to the west. Travellers to any of these countries can easily access Germany by train or plane.
Germany has a lot to offer to curious travellers. The Cologne Cathedral, Reichstag building, Neuschwanstein Castle, Heidelberg Castle, Aachen Cathedral, Leipzig Zoological Garden are some of the buildings that attract the most visitors.
If you travel to Germany at the right time, you may experience events like the Oktoberfest, the Cologne Carnival, the Berlinale film festival, or Unity Day.
The modern era Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland consists of four constituent countries: England, Scotland, Wales, and Northern Ireland. The country has played a very important role throughout the history of Europe and the world.
Castles, palaces, churches and other buildings constructed in different periods of history stand still and attract millions of visitors annually. Among the most visited are Stonehenge, the Roman Baths and Georgian City of Bath, Canterbury Cathedral, the Cotswolds, Warwick Castle and Stirling Castle.
37.7 million travellers entered the country in 2017, 1.9 million more than the previous year and 600K less than in 2018. The number of tourists is in particular high during bank holidays and the summer months.

The Austrian Alps are well-known as a winter sports attraction. Innsbruck is a must-visit for all those passionate about skiing, or who want to get away from the busy city life.
The cradle of western civilization, the Hellenic Republic of Greece hosts millions of visitors every year. It has been a tourist attraction since antiquity. 27.2 million people visited the country in 2017, after 24.8 million visitors in the previous year. In 2018 the number increased to 30.1 million tourists.
Among the most famous spots for visitors are the Acropolis, the monasteries of Meteora, the mystical Delphi ruins, the Temple of Hephaestus and many more. The capital of Athens, Thessaloniki, Corfu, Santorini and Crete are among the most visited cities and islands. There are more than 200 Greek islands that you can visit, each more beautiful than the other.
Food in Greece is a unique experience itself. It is a mixture of traditional Greek food influenced by Turkish and Italian cuisine. Greeks are especially known for their seafood and cheese.
The biggest country in the world is the ninth most visited in the European continent. 24.5 million travellers visited Russia in 2018.
There is a lot to explore and see in Russia. The Saint Basil’s Cathedral looks as if it has gotten straight out of a fairytale. The Hermitage Museum and Kremlin also look fairytalish. Buildings from Imperial Russia such as the Bolshoi Theatre, the Kazan Cathedral and the Singer House are stunning as well.
There are a lot of natural wonders, such as Lake Baikal, Kizhi Island, Valley of Geysers, and Mount Elbrus. Russian ski resorts are in particular famous among Europeans.
22.8 million people visited Portugal in 2018, mostly interested in seeing the capital Lisbona, the city of Porto, Odemira, Faro and the city of Sintra.
There is a lot to do in Portugal, from visiting old castles and palaces to surfing at the sea. The old village of Sortelha, the Pena Palace, the Castle of the Moors, the historic fishing town of Cascais and the waterfalls of the Azores are among the things you must see if you are travelling to Portugal.
Portugal has a coastline of 1,794 km and shares its borders only with Spain. It has stunning beaches, crowded ones and others hidden.

Sanjay Leela Bhansali's Hum Dil De Chuke Sanam starred Salman Khan, Ajay Devgn and Aishwarya Rai. This film is one of the most loved and iconic films made by Sanjay Leela Bhansali. This film is also considered a cult classic. From the chemistry between the lead actors to the mature acting of the supporting cast this film was loved by fans. But did you know that the climax of the film which was shown as Italy in the film was actually not Italy? Read here to know more about it.
Aishwarya Rai was seen in the role of Nandini in the film. She plays the role of a daughter of a classical singer from whom Sameer (Salman Khan) comes to learn music. But while he is learning music he falls in love with the teacher's daughter. While both are in love Nandini's parents do not agree to the notion of Sameer getting married to Nandini and she is then married to Vanraj played by Ajay Devgn.
But towards the end of the film, she travels all the way to meet her love Sameer. It is all possible as Vanraj learns about their love and makes an effort to unite the lovers. But all fans of the film know what happens at the end. But here is the interesting bit about this film's climax. Nandini says that she wants to go to Italy but if we actually see the place where the shoot happened was Budapest.
The makers of the film Sanjay Leela Bhansali passed off Budapest as Italy to the viewers. The cast of the movie had travelled to Budapest where the shoot was done on the Chain Bridge located in Budapest. This place is one of the most popular tourist places in the city. But all fans know that the scene from the film was fantastically shot. Take a look at the clip here to know more.
Ajay Devgn was last seen in the movie Tanhaji: The Unsung Warrior . this film was based on the real-life story of Maratha Warrior Tanaji Malusare. The movie stars Ajay Devgn, Kajol, and Saif Ali Khan in the lead roles. Ajay was seen portraying the role of Tanhaji, Kajol was seen as Lakshmi Bai, and Saif Ali Khan was seen in the role of Udaybhan Rathod.

They are variations of a common meteorological phenomenon known as the orographic effect. The process through which they develop follows the same steps no matter where they are found throughout the world. Would you like more information on how these winds develop?",The process through which they develop follows the same steps no matter where they are found throughout the world.,"Most of us are unfamiliar with Chinook (or Föehn) winds, but they are all just variations of a common meteorological phenomenon known as the orographic effect. We examine what they are and how they form.
Chinook winds are warm, dry winds that blow down the eastern slopes of the Rocky Mountains through a process called the orographic effect. As moist air from the Pacific Ocean rises against the western slopes, it cools & causes precipitation. The dry air warms as it descends down the eastern slopes.
If you live in an area surrounding the region that commonly experiences these winds , you may be familiar with the names. But what exactly are Chinook winds, and how do they develop in the first place?
Chinook winds got their name from the Chinook Native American people who lived in coastal areas near the Columbia River (in the States of Washington and Oregon), where these winds occur on a regular basis.
Föehn winds originate from the German word ""Föhn,"" which literally means hot, dry wind. It is in this region of the Alps in Central Europe where this occurrence was first studied.
Although these winds have different names, depending on the region where they occur, they are exactly the same weather phenomena, no matter where they form in the world.
As just stated, the first thing to know about Chinook and Föehn winds is that they are essentially the same type of wind. You may not be aware of it, but the area you live in or one nearby may regularly experience these air movements on a seasonal basis.
By providing a quick summary of what Chinook winds are, and then giving a more detailed description of the Föehn winds they are based upon, one will be able to get a clear understanding of what these type of winds are an how they are created.
Chinook winds (also known as Föehn or Föhn winds) are warm, dry winds that blow down the eastern slopes of the Rocky Mountains through a process called the orographic effect. As moist air from the Pacific Oceans rises against the western slopes, it cools & causes precipitation. The dry air warms as it descends down the eastern slopes.
As already mentioned in the introduction, Föhn (Föehn) winds were first identified and studied in Central Europe's Alps.
The name ""Chinook"" simply refers to the Native Americans who lived in the region where this phenomenon frequently occurs but are essentially nothing more than Föehn winds.
The process through which a Föehn wind develops follows the same steps, no matter where they are found throughout the world:
As moist, warm air blows and reaches the windward side of a mountain, it starts to ascend against the mountain slopes. As it gains altitude , the air also starts to cool down.
Once the air reaches a height where the air has cooled down enough for condensation to take place, precipitation in the form of rain and snow follows. In the process, the air loses most of its moisture, while the condensation also allows for the release of latent heat.
(As contradictory as it may sound, condensation is known as a warming process, and evaporation as a cooling process. To make more sense of these seemingly opposing statements, you can find detailed a more detailed explanation in this article .)
As the air reaches the mountain top, it is now both dry as a result of the precipitation and slightly warmer due to the release of latent heat during the condensation process.
It now starts it descend down the leeward side of the mountain. As the air continues to move downward, the effects of gravity force it to speeds up and become warmer as it continues to accelerate down the slopes towards the bottom of the mountain.
The mass of descending air also has a significant effect on the heating process. As the large volume of air descends, it causes the air to compress. The descending mass of air causes so much pressure that it results in the air heating up, a process called adiabatic heating.
All these steps and processes combined result in a warm, dry wind of considerable strength, known as Chinooks, Föhns.
Regions situated on the leeward side of a mountain experiencing this phenomenon usually experience warmer and more pleasant weather conditions in a cloudless sky.
This process is also commonly known as the orographic effect (or orographic lifting) . Find out more detail about this process and how it works in this article .
The warm and pleasant weather experienced by areas in Central Europe parts of Northwest America as a result of these winds is not the only effect they have on the environment.
The warm and dry nature of these winds resulted in the name ""ice-eaters,"" due to their ability to melt and even evaporate ice before it can melt. A strong Föehn wind is able to make a layer of 30 centimeters (12 inches) of snow ""vanish"" within a day.
The intensity of some Chinook wind occurrences can lead to exposed losing a large percentage of its moisture. It has been reported that wind gusts from a Chinook wind can exceed speeds of 120 km/h (75 mph). This can have a widespread negative effect.
Ingeniousness vegetation naturally will suffer as a result, but it has an even larger impact on the agricultural sector, where crop losses can impact the local economy.
Several debates are ongoing around the real health effects of Chinook/Föehn winds. It seems the most significant discussion revolves around the issue of whether these winds have a real health impact or are just perceived as such by people who are ""affected.""
However, there seems to be consensus over the general health effects of this phenomenon. This applies to both the positive and negative impacts of Föehn winds.
On the positive side, the people whose lives are severely inhibited by freezing conditions find their lives easier to manage, as their daily activities are made simpler. Their bodies can cope much better under warmer conditions.
A general feeling of well-being has also been documented, but it's unclear whether it is a result of the relief mentioned in the previous paragraph or if the warmer weather and clear skies directly trigger these emotions.
(The clear skies allow sunlight through, which helps to generate vitamin D in the body, which is responsible for the release of endorphins.)
On the negative side, Föehn winds are connected to the migraines many people are experiencing during the occurrence of this phenomenon. So much so that these migraines are often referred to as Chinook headaches.
Less serious and related effects have also been documented, but many of these have not been substantiated or enough research is done.
After reading this article, the ""shroud of mystery"" should have been lifted over the foreign-sounding Chinook and Föehn winds.
These winds also have many other names, mostly related to the region where they occur. In South Africa, they are commonly known as a Bergwind, in California the Santa Ana, in Argentina the Zonda winds, and in Slovenia the Fen.
The examples mentioned in the previous paragraph are just a few examples of a number of local names used for the same phenomenon.
So rest assured, the Chinook or Föehn winds you experienced first hand or just heard about are just local names given to a normal phenomenon experienced throughout the world.

Maybe you just moved into a new high rise in Philadelphia, PA or a studio apartment in Columbus, OH , and you just got your new keys. When you go to unlock your apartment, you may notice that there isn’t a hole for a key but instead, there’s a small box next to your door. Don’t worry, you haven’t been scammed. Most likely, your building is just set up to use key fobs instead of keys.
Key fobs are sleek, usually black or gray, and a little smaller than your average key. In fact, you’ve probably seen a key fob before, since more and more cars use them instead of keys to start their engine. You can find your apartment key fob on the keyring your landlord gave you when you moved in. Depending on how your building is set up, you can use your key fob to access your building, apartment, and other amenities in your apartment building, like the elevator and gym.
If you’ve never had an apartment key fob before, you may have a bunch of questions. How do apartment key fobs work? How do you copy an apartment key fob? How do you get an apartment key fob replaced? Can apartment key fobs be tracked? Read on for answers to these questions and more.
Apartment key fobs are a convenient entry option for apartments. Usually, they are small, circular objects a little smaller than a key. You can easily put them on your key ring and they unlock doors simply by tapping them against a sensor near the door you want to open.
Every apartment building uses apartment key fobs differently. For example, one building may have key fobs that open only the front door, while other buildings will have you use your key fob to enter the building, stairwell, elevator, and even your apartment. If you’re apartment shopping, you may want to check in with each apartment building to see how and where they use key fobs.
Key fobs use RFID, or radio frequency identification. What does that mean? Basically, your key fob is programmed to transmit a certain frequency when tapped against a sensor. The sensor will pick up on that frequency and run it through a central computer system, which will tell the sensor whether it’s a match or not. If it’s a match, the door will unlock for you.
Most apartment key fobs will stop working if the power goes out, since they require a central computer system to recognize the fob and unlock the door. So, make sure your apartment building has a back-up plan or generator if they use key fobs, just in case a power outage hits.
Maybe you have a pet sitter coming over, or you just got a roommate. Are you allowed to copy your key fob? The short answer is, probably.
If you need an extra key fob or an apartment key fob replacement, there are a few ways to go about getting one. First, most property managers offer the option to buy additional key fobs from them. This is a great way to go because you know it is allowed by your building, and you know the key fob will be programmed correctly. On the other hand, the convenience of this option usually comes at a cost.
You may be able to copy your apartment key fob at a lower cost by going to a locksmith or key copying kiosk. However, there are some situations in which you can’t copy your key. For instance, some lease agreements forbid copying key fobs. Other keys and key fobs have “Do Not Duplicate” written on them, so you can’t copy them. Other apartment key fobs are copy-protected, which means that they have special software installed which prevents machines from being able to read and replicate them.
As with any new apartment, make sure to read through your lease agreement before you move in, so you know what options are available to you.
There are some situations where you may lose your key fob, or your key fob stops working, and you get locked out of your apartment . What can you do if that happens?
As explained above, you can probably copy your key fob like any other key, or you can ask your landlord or building super for an apartment key fob replacement. “If any key fob is stolen, lost, or damaged, it can quickly be deactivated and replaced with a reprogrammed fob. You will never have to change locks again,” adds Tom Krones from Host Tools .
If your key fob stops working, you can ask your landlord to have it reprogrammed or ask for a new fob. Hopefully, your property manager won’t charge you for a new key fob if your old one just stopped working.
In case you want to know how much either of these options will cost you or what you should do if you get locked out for any reason, go back through your lease agreement, it should be listed out for you.
In the meantime, before your key fob is back to working again, your landlord can probably help you out. Most property managers and maintenance workers have a master key ring, including a key fob, which they can use to unlock your door for you.
Again, check out your lease to see what options you have if you get locked out of your apartment or if you have trouble with your key fob.
In some ways, key fobs are actually safer than physical keys because the locks can’t be picked and if you lose it you can have it deactivated. Plus, they can be connected to cameras and other security systems to monitor entrances and exits. In other words, you can check out when your apartment is being entered or exited. Ori Residential’s Assistant Property Manager, Jesse Tavenner, explains, “Not only can you see every person who comes in and out of the apartment, but you can also control the access they allow to certain places in the building. For example, if you want to use the elevator you have to first scan your fob before it will move to a floor, and it will only let you go to the floor that your unit is on (other than common areas, of course). This prevents strangers from being able to gain close access to people’s units if they somehow were able to get into the building.” Key fobs essentially add an extra level of security.
Since apartment key fobs can be programmed and deactivated remotely, they come with a ton of benefits:
- Quick to program
- Quick to deactivate if you lose them
- Can be connected to alarms, cameras, and other security features
- Can be connected to your phone for alerts
- Can create custom codes for certain levels of access
- Your key fob gets a code that’s unique to you
On the other hand, key fobs aren’t perfect:
- They’ll stop working if there’s no electricity
- You’ll need help from management if you have technical issues
- Your key fob may need batteries
As with any apartment key, there are a few guidelines you should follow in taking care of your apartment key fob. Following these general rules will help you waste less money on keys and get your security deposit back when you eventually move out of your apartment.
To avoid paying any extra money to your landlord for replacement keys or lockouts, duplicate keys yourself, if you can. Copying keys yourself is usually cheaper than buying extras from your property manager. And you can use that extra key as a back-up if you ever get locked out or if you decide to live with a roommate .
When you move out, make sure you give all of your spare keys back to your property manager. Having loose keys is a security problem for your landlord, and you’ll probably have to pay a fine for not returning all of your keys when you move out.
A huge part of being able to return all your keys when you move out is being able to round up all of them. For that reason, make sure not to hand out too many extra keys to friends and family. Consider giving a spare key or two to one or two trusted people and that’s it.
Lastly, hand your keys in on time. Most landlords will charge a late fee if they have to wait weeks or months for you to get your keys in.
The following are other types of apartment keys you may find through your apartment search. Each can be used in different ways, depending on how the property manager wants to secure the building best. For instance, an apartment building may use a traditional key for building and unit access, while they use a key fob for access to amenities like the gym. Or, they may use a key fob for everything.
If you’re prone to locking yourself out of your apartment, keyless entry may be the best option for you. With keyless entry, you can let yourself in using your phone, passcode, or other “key.” You also have the ability to grant temporary access codes to people like friends or baby sitters when you’re away. More and more apartment buildings are offering keyless entry since it is convenient and a trendy smart home addition. Vincent Breslin, the founder of Uplisting , believes keyless entry is the way of the future, “Especially for property owners that rent out their units. Not only is it a safer option, but it also simplifies the turnover process! While the initial cost may be greater than that of traditional key fobs, the time you save by not having to be physically present during turnover more than makes up for it.”
The one downside to keyless entry is that it isn’t so great if there’s a power outage or power failure.
Key cards usually use a magnetic stripe or RFID, depending on what kind of key card you get. Most apartment buildings don’t use key cards anymore, but they may be used to unlock the building, access the elevator, gym, or other amenities.
Key cards are inexpensive, small, and can easily be created or replicated, which makes them pretty convenient. They are wallet-sized, which is another plus. As with traditional keys and key fobs, you’ll have to ask for help if you lose your key card, and power outages can be a problem if your building isn’t prepared.
Metal keys are the only physical keys that won’t let you down if you lose electricity. Plus, they’re usually the easiest and least expensive to copy. The major downside with traditional keys is that you can’t deactivate them if you lose them, which could become a security problem. And, if you get locked out, you’ll need to find help.
Your property manager can see when you unlock doors using your key fob data, but they can’t track your key fob’s location.
Key fobs will stop working in a handful of different circumstances. If they are damaged, deactivated, lost, or stolen, you won’t be able to use them anymore. Same thing goes if your apartment building’s computer system is having an off day or if the electricity goes out, they won’t work, unless your building has a backup generator.
While not all key fobs require batteries, some do. They last for a long time though, most often somewhere from 4-7 years.
If you have a key fob that requires a battery, you can expect them to cost usually less than $10.
Your key fob can be programmed by your property manager or a key copying service. If your key fob has technical difficulties, you’ll probably need to bring it to your landlord to be reprogrammed.
Each apartment key fob is programmed so that every tenant gets a unique code. In other words, no apartment key fob is exactly the same, even though they look exactly the same and sometimes open the same doors.
No, apartment key fobs don’t have GPS. But, your apartment building can track when you enter and exit your building by tracking your key fob usage data.

In the mythology presented by the ruling Party, Emmanuel Goldstein is the arch-traitor and public enemy number one. If Big Brother is the semi-divine leader, Goldstein is like the devil. Once a loyal follower of Big Brother, he turned to contrarevolutionary activities. He is constantly vilified in official propaganda. No one knows his whereabouts, but he is supposedly the leader of an underground army that seeks to overthrow the “benevolent” regime of Big Brother.
In actuality, George Orwell’s novel as a whole subtly suggests that neither Big Brother nor Goldstein are real people, and nobody ev

The story, 1984, is basically about the ongoing daily changes of history, at the micro-management level, by the Ministry of Truth, where Winston Smith worked. The entire idea is set around turning real people, who have achieved some notoriety as individuals, into non-persons, or people who have never existed. In effect, people’s existence is erased.
Then you have Big Brother, who appears to be a constant, but no one really knows who it is, or if it is a real person. The population accepts Big Brother as a real individual because they have no frame of reference, or evidence, to suggest otherwise

Emmanuel Goldstein represents Leon Trotsky who was a member of the bolsheviks until Stalin saw him as a threat and exiled him. After his exile he was portrayed inside the USSR with so much fear and hatred as Stalin feared Trotsky could return and take over (Trotsky was seen by many as the legitimate successor to Lenin, not Stalin.)

I certainly believe it is although I agree with Neil Postman where in ""Amusing Ourselves to Death: Public Discourse in the Age of Show Business"", he proposes that today's world is much more like Aldus Huxley's ""A Brave New World"" rather than George Orwell's 1984.

He seems to have been inspired by Leon Trotsky, a major figure of the Russian revolution and early Soviet regime who was stripped of his position and exiled when Stalin took control of the communist party after Lenin’s death.
From exile Trotsky continued opposing Stalin until murdered on the orders of Stalin.
Similarly in the novel 1984 Emmanuel Goldstein was an early high level member of the Party who later grew to oppose its leader Big Brother and founded a secret organisation to oppose Ingsoc.
He is also the author of a forbidden book, The Theory and Practice of Oligarchical Collectivism , whic

He may perhaps be “based on” a real Party member that once lived, but who has in reality been eliminated decades ago. However, the Party saw fit to keep his image alive as a focusing-point for hatred. All that is wrong in Oceania can be blamed on Goldstein and his agents, and at the same time Goldstein is presented as advocating democratic values like free speech, which the population is thus conditioned to think of as something evil.
The state ideology is like a religion where Big Brother and Goldstein are God and the Devil, respectively.

No, unfortunately George Orwell never wrote another book after Nineteen Eighty-Four. When creating the novel and typing the manuscript, Orwell was working at quite a furious pace. He knew his physical health was in decline but was determined to finish his Nineteen Eighty-Four manuscript. Soon afterwards, George Orwell passed away in hospital, due to an artery bursting in his lungs.
Thanks for reading.

It doesn’t.

He was a fabrication of the regime and the reader is led to believe that he doesn’t really exist- he’s a sort of Uncle Sam-style figure who acted as an embodiment of the Inner Party. Winston Smith’s tormentor, O’Brien, states this explicitly in the novel.
But then again, this implies that there is some sort of universal truth outside of what the Inner Party dictates. He eventually comes to exist in Winston’s mind. Maybe he does exist?
That aside, it’s supposed to be a satire of Joseph Stalin and his personality cult, whom George Orwell loathed. His nemesis is Emmanuel Goldstein, which is barely

Emmanuel Goldstein is a fictional character in George Orwell 's 1949 dystopian novel Nineteen Eighty-Four . He is the principal enemy of the state according to the Party of the totalitarian Oceania . He is depicted as the head of a mysterious and possibly fictitious dissident organization called ""The Brotherhood"" and as having written the ?book The Theory and Practice of Oligarchical Collectivism . He is only seen and heard on telescreen , and may be a fabrication of the Ministry of Truth , the State's propaganda department.

In the novel, the only answer we ever get to this question is O’Brien’s. And that answer may be the most terrifying speech ever written.
The Party seeks power entirely for its own sake. We are not interested in the good of others; we are interested solely in power. Not wealth or luxury or long life or happiness: only power, pure power. What pure power means you will understand presently. We are different from all the oligarchies of the past, in that we know what we are doing. All the others, even those who resembled ourselves, were cowards and hypocrites.

Originally Answered: What is the real background of ""1984""? And what does George Orwell want to express through the book? I want to know very detailed.
Orwell was a dedicated socialist who regarded both communism and capitalism with horror. He was, as he said many times, devoting all his efforts against totalitarianism in any form, communism, fascism, or capitalism and imperialism with a thin veneer of democracy.
Anyone who imagines Orwell was only anti communist, or bizarrely claims that this lifelong dedicated socialist was anti socialist, misses the point or engages in wishful thinking. As he himself said, ""It means us, too."" Anti communism was as much the enemy as communism.
The term Orwellian has come to have some very specific meani

He fell just short of a repeat championship, but Kylian Mbappé can take consolation in winning the 2022 FIFA World Cup Golden Boot.
With his hat trick in Sunday's epic final loss to Argentina , France's superstar forward finished the tournament with eight goals – one better than Lionel Messi, who came in second and took home the Silver Boot.
La Albiceleste 's Julian Alvarez and Les Bleus ' Olivier Giroud both scored four goals each, but the Manchester City striker claimed the Bronze Boot thanks to his lone assist, versus none for his AC Milan counterpart.

T he Academy of Motion Pictures Arts and Sciences — which has shown some progress in recent years in its attempts to diversify its membership — honored a number of fresh faces alongside some familiar Hollywood staples at the 91st Academy Awards .
While 2019 saw several major Oscar firsts , the number of actors, directors, movies and filmmakers who have won the most Academy Awards in the history of the ceremony didn’t really change. Meryl Streep, who was not nominated this year, continues to hold the record for the greatest number of nominations ever received by an actor. She’s one of several stars who have earned so many Oscar nominations throughout the years that many people assume they hold all the Academy Award records. But this isn’t quite true — although people like Streep, Steven Spielberg and Cate Blanchett have received many nominations, the number of people who have actually taken home the gold statue multiple times is surprisingly small.

Below, see which actors, directors, movies and filmmakers have won the most Oscars in the history of the Academy Awards.
Out of all nominees in Academy Awards history, Walt Disney holds the most Oscars. Disney won 26 Oscars over the course of his career and was nominated a grand total of 59 times. Most of his Oscars, won between 1932 and 1969, came in the category of Best Animated Short, including The Three Little Pigs , The Ugly Duckling and a posthumous win for Winnie the Pooh and the Blustery Day .
Katharine Hepburn holds the distinction of winning the most Oscars for acting, with four Academy Awards and a total of 12 nominations. Hepburn won for her roles in the films Morning Glory (1933), Guess Who’s Coming to Dinner (1967), The Lion in Winter (1968) and On Golden Pond (1981).
The director John Ford, best known for his Westerns, holds the record of the most Oscars for directing. Nominated a total of five times, Ford holds four Oscars, for the films The Informer (1935), The Grapes of Wrath (1940), How Green Was My Valley (1941) and The Quiet Man (1952).
Alfonso Cuarón, who won Best Director for Roma at the 2019 Oscars, is close to Ford’s record. It’s his second Best Director win, with the first for Gravity in 2014.
Three movies share the record for the most Oscars. Titanic (1997), Ben-Hur (1959) and The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King (2003) each nabbed 11 Academy Awards in the years in which they were nominated, the highest number of Oscars for one movie. The films All About Eve (1950) and La La Land (2016), with 14 Oscar nominations each, join Titanic as the most Oscar-nominated movies in the Academy’s history.
Meryl Streep has the most Oscar nominations ever, a record she set and then broke last year when she scooped her 21st nod for her role as Katharine Graham in Steven Spielberg’s The Post . She previously set the record in 2017, with her 20th Oscar nomination, for Florence Foster Jenkins .

Universal Basic Income (UBI) could be designed to reduce poverty, improve income security and boost well-being, but could be expensive and challenging to introduce. Many of its goals could be achieved through changes to the existing social security system and addressing the underlying causes of insecurity in the labour and housing markets.
Universal Basic Income (UBI, Citizens’ Basic Income – CBI, or simply Basic Income) is an idea whose time appears to have come. The Welsh Government has committed to trialling it, the Scottish Government has invested in the feasibility of pilots, several English cities are keen to test it out and a number of political parties included UBI trials in their manifestos. But is it really the right basis on which to build a post-pandemic society? What problems is it trying to solve? Is it the only or the best solution to those issues?
There are many models but at its heart it is a regular cash payment every individual receives, without any reference to their other income or wealth and without any conditions. Payment amounts can vary according to broad demographic characteristics, such as a different payment for working-age adults, children and pensioners.
It is important to distinguish UBI from a Minimum Income Guarantee, which at its most basic is simply a set of policies designed to ensure no one falls below a set income level.
Some argue that Universal Basic Income is part of a radical rethinking of our economy and society, that provides a level of economic security to everyone and destigmatises the social security system. It is also seen as a potential solution to insecurity in the labour market.
The social security problems which UBI could help to address include -
- Coverage. Too many people locked out of the support they need, due to:
Policy design - for example, deficiencies in maternity and paternity pay, support whilst training, and low-earning workers without Statutory Sick Pay.
Non-take up - due to stigma, lack of awareness, mistakes, the difficulty or unpleasantness of the system.
Dropping out of the system - because of conditions or treatment.
Sanctions - losing part or all of your benefits because you are deemed not to have met the conditions of receipt.
Delays, errors and problems with benefits - which can result in people having to go for long periods of time with little or no income.
- Adequacy. High poverty rates for some groups even when they receive social security and are meeting work or activity requirements, demonstrate its current inadequacy. Official food insecurity statistics show 4 in 10 Universal Credit claimants can’t even afford food. Providing a high enough universal payment could ensure everyone has the resources to meet basic standards of living, preventing poverty or destitution.
- Uncertainty. Many people, particularly those on low incomes, emphasise the importance of having predictable and stable payments. Yet people often experience variable and unpredictable fluctuations in benefit payments.
- Complexity. Any system which tailors support to individual circumstances will entail some complexity. Introducing ever more means-testing and conditions attached to various benefits requires more complex systems and processes.
- Dignity, respect and well-being. Not all benefit claimants experience problems or feel they are treated poorly. But some find the culture of our social security system suspicious, disrespectful and undignified. There is evidence of the negative impact of these experiences on people’s mental health. Over many years, the ramping up of conditionality and means testing has been accompanied by a narrative of ‘scroungers and skivers’, a presumption that there are large numbers of people trying to game the system, and a drive to reduce claimant numbers.
Some advocates also argue that UBI could improve work incentives, if it was either not withdrawn at all as people earned more or was withdrawn at a lower rate than in the current benefit system. (Although others worry that the incentive to enter work at all might be reduced if people could rely on a high enough income outside it, discussed further below).
Alongside problems in our social security system, many advocates also see UBI as a response to increasing insecurity in our labour market. Too often low-paid jobs are unpredictable and insecure. Workers don’t know what shifts or hours they will be working from one week to the next or how long the job will last. People cycle in and out of low-paid, temporary jobs, never able to rely on a steady income. UBI could provide a fixed income stream to offset this earnings volatility. In addition, some argue that UBI would free people to choose whether to take paid work or care for others, train or do other activities, and would recognise the value to society of such activities. In this scenario, it might bring wider benefits through better job matches and people holding out for better quality work, creating pressure on employers to pay more and achieve greater productivity. There are also wider debates about the extent to which automation may lead to significantly fewer jobs or climate change may necessitate such major economic changes that there will be a new norms of people doing much less paid work. For some, UBI is a necessary accompaniment to such radical economic changes.
Finally, there are a range of other arguments put forward for UBI which do not relate to poverty, social security or labour market insecurity, such as the idea it would reduce the level of state involvement in people’s lives. In this piece, we focus on the arguments relating to poverty and insecurity. There are, of course, versions of UBI which would significantly increase poverty by reducing the support provided to those on low incomes, but we assume these would not be proposed by those aiming to reduce poverty.
Most UBI proposals now include two features, in contrast to some earlier proposals which intended to replace all benefits with UBI or introduce UBI without accompanying tax changes. Alongside flat payments, there would continue to be a system of benefits linked to costs. A system of flat payments alone could not offer adequate support with varying costs of housing, childcare or disability. This means that there would continue to be a degree of complexity and means-testing even if UBI was introduced (sometimes known as UBI+ ), and that efforts to improve the existing system must continue. Second, UBI would replace parts of the tax system as well as social security. Most likely, the tax-free personal allowance would be removed, so people would pay tax on the entirety of their earned income. Depending on the design, many on lower- to middle-incomes would more than recoup this in the universal payment.
A key design question is obviously the level at which UBI is set. Would it be based below, at, or just above current benefit levels? Or provide much higher payments, for instance at the level of JRF’s Minimum Income Standard?* This would be the main determinant of both the cost of UBI and its immediate impact on poverty levels.
A recent study by the Fraser of Allander Institute, Manchester Metropolitan University and IPPR Scotland, examined the costs and benefits of a Citizen’s Basic Income in Scotland at current benefit or at Minimum Income Standard level. These costs relate to introducing the scheme in Scotland; those for a UK-wide version would be much higher. However, estimates of necessary tax rate increases would be similar whether in Scotland or across the whole country.
A UBI based on current benefit levels would bring clear gains for those who are currently ineligible, where they are on a low income but are shut out, or fall out, of the existing system; it would probably bring smaller gains for many of those successfully claiming current benefits. Fraser of Allander et al estimates the costs and impacts of introducing this kind of UBI in Scotland. This scheme would require £7 billion in net additional funding (after existing benefits have been reduced and the tax-free personal allowance eliminated), paid for by increasing all tax rates by eight percentage points. UBI at this level would deliver lower levels of poverty and greater income security (reducing the number of people in poverty in Scotland by a quarter and child poverty by a third). However, it seems unlikely to achieve wider goals of significantly reducing insecurity and allowing more people to choose whether to care, train, or hold out for better jobs.
Introducing a higher level of UBI, for instance at Minimum Income Standard level , would potentially achieve these benefits and almost eradicate poverty in Scotland, but would be extremely expensive. Fraser of Allander et al estimates this would require £38 billion in net additional funding (again, after existing benefits have been reduced and the tax-free personal allowance eliminated). If funded through income tax it would require tax rates to start at 58p for the first £1 earned and rise to 85p for the higher and top rates. The Minimum Income Standard is significantly higher than the poverty line. An alternative would be to set UBI rates at or around the poverty line. This would be less costly than a version based on the Minimum Income Standard but still very expensive.
The specific design of UBI significantly impacts the distribution of winners and losers, and increases or decreases in poverty amongst different groups. Some proposals result in higher poverty for some groups than under the current social security system. One version with UBI payments based mainly on current benefit levels (funded by increasing tax rates by three percentage points and abolishing the tax-free personal allowance and National Insurance thresholds) would reduce poverty overall but lead to higher poverty rates for children and lone parents. Around 20% of people in the poorest fifth would lose more than 5% of their income (despite the scheme being highly redistributive overall).
Other proposals avoid big losses for people on low incomes. Malcolm Torry proposed a UBI payment of £60 per week, funded by raising the basic, higher and top rates of tax by two, three and four percentage points respectively (and substantially reducing – though not eliminating - the tax-free personal allowance and National Insurance threshold). This reduces the number of people in poverty by 16% and children in poverty by 13%, while fewer than 2% of the poorest fifth of households lose more than 5% of their income. Compass proposed a scheme that reduces working-age poverty by a fifth and child poverty by a third, with only around 1% of people in the bottom fifth losing more than 5% of their income. It raises existing tax rates by three percentage points, abolishes the tax-free personal allowance and National Insurance thresholds, and introduces a starter tax rate of 15% on the first £11,850 of earnings. However, that leaves a funding gap of £28 billion.
These models provide only illustrative examples of how UBI might be funded by income tax. In reality, such radical changes might require a more balanced tax response (such as wealth or carbon taxes) but there is no doubt that significant tax rises would be necessary.
Would giving people an income regardless of work lead to many more people deciding not to take paid employment, valuing the unpaid work of carers and contributions to society other than paid jobs? If so, would that damage or improve our economy and society? Alternatively, UBI could increase work incentives by reducing the rate at which income from it was reduced as someone earned more. For example, Universal Credit is reduced by 63p in every pound earned above a set level; under some versions of UBI this would change to someone losing only 20p for every pound earned.
Economic models estimate employment effects purely through a financial lens. Work incentives are calculated according to the net financial gain from taking a job or increasing earnings. Most modelling suggests that UBI (accompanied by higher taxes on earnings to pay for it) would have a complex mix of impacts. Some groups see increased work incentives because their benefits are reduced by less as they move into work or earn more. Others have lower work incentives due to unearned income and higher tax rates. Under the version of UBI modelled by Fraser of Allander et al, the overall result was that UBI reduced financial incentives to work and so could lead to a lower labour supply and a smaller economy. By contrast, Martinelli and Pearce found that several UBI schemes strengthened work incentives on average for low- and middle-income households.
A change on the scale of UBI would be likely to affect other aspects of our economy, for instance how wages were set. It is hard to predict how individuals and businesses might react to such changes. In addition, in the real world we don’t make decisions purely on the basis assumed in economic modelling. There is limited evidence about how people respond to UBI in practice. So far, trials suggest that providing an unconditional payment may not have the negative employment effects found in some modelling. Finland is the only country to have carried out a nationwide, randomised control trial of UBI. The evaluation found that people receiving basic income were more likely to be in work than those in the control group. This is not conclusive, due to the introduction of other unemployment policies at the same time, although the signs from other smaller trials have also been positive, such as those in Stockton (USA) and the Netherlands . However, these trials have not examined the potential employment effects of changes to tax rates or other measures to fund such a system.
One of the potential benefits of UBI is the removal of stress caused by means-tests, conditionality and uncertainty about whether support will be withdrawn, coupled with destigmatisation of social security support. This could lead to better mental and physical health. It is easy to see the well-being advantages of a system providing a reliable income, uncoupled from complex conditions, shorn of the fear of failing and the feeling of being seen as a scrounger or having to continually prove your eligibility. The limited evidence from trials backs up this theory. In Finland, people on basic income reported higher life satisfaction, better health and lower levels of depression and loneliness.
Some versions of UBI could reduce poverty and improve recipients’ mental health and well-being. But it would be expensive. It would require significant increases in tax rates, which people may be reluctant to accept, even if many of those on low- to middle-incomes would be better off overall once receipt of their UBI payment is accounted for. The principle of offering payments without conditions might well also meet resistance among the public.
Public attitudes towards welfare have been softening in recent years , with increasing support for raising benefit levels. There has also been rising willingness to pay more tax to fund more public spending. However, when asked what kind of public spending additional taxes should be spent on , very few people prioritise social security. When asked directly about UBI, some studies show a sizeable minority of the public are receptive to the idea, at least of a pilot, but with no majority in favour and significant concerns about cost and use of the money, even among supporters; other studies suggest around half may be in favour. JRF polling in Scotland found a majority in favour of the Minimum Income Guarantee and significant minorities receptive to the idea of UBI, but no majority for that, or for increasing unemployment benefits. Willingness to personally pay more tax to fund UBI may well also be much lower than such polling implies. YouGov polling in 2020 examined whether the British public would be willing to pay more in tax to deal with the costs of the pandemic. It found that the public did support tax rises, but not for themselves. Only a quarter would back a tax rise that affected everyone.
A second barrier to introducing UBI nationally is the potential complexity and disruption of introducing large-scale changes to the social security and tax systems. The roll-out of Universal Credit has shown just how challenging such a change can be, for claimants, staff and civil society. Many of those who rely on social security feel extremely fearful about transferring from one benefit to another, or from one system to another. The extent of potential disruption does depend on the details of the scheme. The addition of a small simple new universal payment while maintaining the rest of the existing benefit system around it might be less challenging.
It is undoubtedly true that our social security system is failing to protect people from destitution and hardship. We need better coverage and to invest more in the system. But a multitude of changes to the existing system would go a long way to achieving those goals, without the expense and disruption of a new system. We could remove the benefit cap, the two-child limit and the five-week wait; extend sick pay to all; boost support for those at most risk of poverty; run national take up campaigns and reform council tax. A range of other measures, such as these , could be taken to fulfil other goals or principles of UBI. None of these individual changes would eradicate poverty, as a generous UBI system would. They would all require money and political will. But pursuing such improvements could transform the system for a fraction of the cost and difficulty of that kind associated with UBI.
Our current system fails to ensure that all those within it are treated with dignity and respect. It causes unnecessary and harmful stress for too many people and the sanctions regime is unnecessarily punitive. Again, however, we could roll back the complexity and harshness of conditionality and refocus the current system on maximising take up, valuing caring and supporting people to move into high-quality work.
Changing the public and media narrative is necessary to achieving greater and more sustainable investment in our social security system, whether that is to improve the existing system or put a new UBI in place. The question is whether couching the debate in terms of introducing UBI will be more or less effective in building that support compared to focusing more specifically on the different elements that are needed, such as greater understanding of the purpose of social security, greater empathy for those relying on it, the need for adequate support and dignity.
And what about the underlying issue of insecurity in work (and housing for that matter)? Our social security system needs to do more to counter the volatility in earned income that many low-earning workers face. For some, Universal Credit is exaggerating that volatility rather than counterbalancing it. This is a difficult policy challenge, but UBI is not the only way to solve it. Smaller changes could achieve significant improvements such as strengthening more universal elements of the system (like Child Benefit) and contributory benefits; more infrequent reassessments of eligibility for some benefits; run-ons when circumstances change, and disregard when incomes rise or fall by small amounts. Clearer incentives to move into work and increase earnings could be achieved by allowing people to earn more before they started to lose benefits and reducing the ‘taper rate’ so benefits reduce more slowly. All of these would require additional investment, so the argument about funding still needs to be won, but they would probably be less expensive and might be less challenging to achieve than UBI.
Addressing insecurity also requires wider changes to our economy and society – no social security system can or should do the whole job. We must redesign the labour market to offer greater security as well as better pay, training and treatment at work. We need more low-cost rented homes and better rights for private sector renters so that people on low incomes can be freed from the constant fear of homelessness.
UBI is not a silver bullet that would immediately and straightforwardly solve poverty. It could not replace the whole social security system. It is beyond doubt that a UBI that radically reduced poverty levels would require enormous increases in public spending and be a very significant redistribution across society. A smaller, less radical but potentially more immediately achievable, partial UBI payment could achieve some valuable outcomes but would fall short of some of the bigger aims of UBI. There are more targeted ways of achieving similar outcomes, although these might not bring some of the wider impacts of a very generous UBI.
The debate about ambitious interventions to reduce poverty is welcome, underlining the growing consensus that the current social security system is inadequate and does not provide the effective public service we need to protect people from poverty. A social security system that provides adequate support, reduces poverty and removes the indignities and stigma associated with the present system is a vital part of ending the injustice of poverty in the UK. A Minimum Income Guarantee could provide a positive framework within which to make progress. Whatever form it takes, it will require significant investment, for which we must build public support.

The Ohio Liquor Control Commission held an emergency meeting this morning to pass an emergency rule that would limit hours for on-premises sales or consumption and expansion of sales of beer, wine, mixed beverages and spirits for off-premises consumption.
The vote was unanimous after several bar and restaurant owners commented asking the commission not to pass the rule.
Ohio Governor Mike DeWine called on the liquor commission to make changes to how late bars and restaurants can sell alcohol. The plan calls for ending alcohol sales at bars and restaurants at 10 p.m. Customers drinking at the bar or restaurant would then have until 11 p.m. to finish their drinks.
The reason for this change, the governor says, is because of the unique circumstances within bars and some restaurants.
“Let me just say to our bar owners, most of you are doing a phenomenal job. You’re following the directions, you’re doing everything you can to keep your bar open. Sadly, not every bar is doing that,” DeWine said in a Thursday news conference.
“This last week our Ohio investigative unit found bars where no social distancing safety measures were in place. The patrons were packed on outside patios, and a dance floor was packed shoulder to shoulder. Actors like this are in fact outliers,” said the governor. “There is, however, an inherent problem connected with bars. They do lend themselves to going in and out, people in close contact with one another many times indoors. Patrons either stay at one location sometimes for a long time, or they go from bar to bar. Either way, they are interacting with a lot of different people. This is especially true with our younger crowd.”
Michigan is among the states that have now banned inside service in bars, and Indianapolis has required bars to close early. Government officials say it’s because of the difficulty in keeping the coronavirus from spreading.
“We know of a case where a young woman in her twenties joined some college friends for a night out at a few campus bars over the weekend earlier this month,” DeWine said during the news conference. “She then went home, about two and a half hours away. She then later started feeling sick. She learned her friends had tested positive, then she did, too. Her parents got sick. Her brother got sick. So did her grandmother. Thankfully, the whole family quarantined, which prevented the virus from spreading even further.”
The proposed rule would make a change to carryout meals. Earlier this year, the state began to allow two drinks to be sold with carryout meals. As part of this plan, the state would raise the limit to 3 drinks per carryout.
“We do not want to shut down Ohio bars and restaurants. That would be devastating to them. But we do have to take some action, and see what kind of results we get from this action,” said the governor.

I've been holding off on writing this for a while but after listening on constant rotation for about a month now I've got to say this is truly a profound album considering the circumstances. I suspect this album was originally intended to have a different sound but the untimely death of Malik changed this from a Tribe Album that makes a political social statement to an album that's a celebration of a career and a statement album.
This album hit me a couple of ways. In most Tribe Albums we had grown accustomed to the back and forth of Q-tip and Phife while the music is what changed. I think that's why a few I repeat very few people were put off by the sound of this album because it's not like that. Much in the way they did after ""Instinctive Travels"" Tribe has changed their style immensely. True the Fat beats are there but the production is more a Dilla Like approach to production. Not that it sounds like Dilla but Dilla did things in layers and this album has tons of layers. Very different from anything in their catalog.
Oh and let me say this while we don't get as much Phife as we want we get a glimpse of what we've been missing by not having Jarobi around and OMG he kills it. It's like that time when you turn on the Low end theory for the first time and you got blown away by Phife. This album is the same thing except with Jarobi and it leaves you wondering what might have been had they all collaborated consistently on albums. Instead of being one of the greatest Hip Hop groups of all time we may have been talking about them being the greatest period no questions asked.
I'll say this in closing. Tribe is revered because their first three albums were classics. That is unheard of in the music industry before or since. Name me one group or artist that had three classic albums right out of the gate? Well I can say this is very very close to being that 4th classic it's that good. I'm conflicted that its better than Instinctive travels only because it was so different from anything else out at the time. However upon further review so is this album which is so appropriate considering it's their last. Perfect bookends for maybe the best hip hop group ever. Well played gentlemen well played

Okay here we go. A Tribe Called Quest with a new album. What?!
Just a brief background; I'm 26 years old and have been into Tribe since I was 8 years old. It all started with what some called their worst work which is ""The Love Movement"". I was really into music back then, even at an early age, but it was something about the jazzy beats and smoothness that attracted me to Tribe with the song ""Find My Way"". My Mom ordered me the CD from BMG music (yall remember that?) and I still have and listen to the CD. As I grew, I found they had older and even better music as I reached teen years and got into more of their music with the LimeWire, and Kazaa days. It's something about Tribe that I can't just explain. They are like that mythical figure that just doesn't seen real. I'm a huge fan and I'm trying to be as unbiased as possible with this review.
It took me a few listens to get up for this review. For me I like to see a CD marinate. I can't review a CD after a weekend of listening. It takes me a few weeks for me to form my opinion because it changes over time.
The CD is good. I'm not going to say the CD is 5/5. On my scale, that's hard to do. And I can't put this CD on the same level as The Low End Theory or Midnight Marauders. It has some great moments, and in all honestly, this could turn into a 5/5 over time. To be honest every song Phife was apart of was amazing. He is the headline to the best song on the album (""Conrad Tokyo""), and kills everything he does in the CD.
At certain points you can argue that the sound is more of Q-Tip's sound rather the Tribe (yes, Tip does the production on all of Tribe's work, but there is a slight difference in the work from his solo work and his group work.) but Q-Tip is an amazing artist.
Jarobi actually rapping was a pleasant surprise. It makes your wonder what could have been if he actually was on more tracks in the past.
Q-Tip is probably my favorite artist of all-time. His vision for music is amazing. I'm curious to if he has another album brewing.""The Renaissance"" was simply amazing, and is one of my favorite albums of all time. Underrated.
This CD is a banger, and deserves to be in every play list and may be up for a grammy nomination when it's due similar to De La Soul coming in 2017.
Just a brief background; I'm 26 years old and have been into Tribe since I was 8 years old. It all started with what some called their worst work which is ""The Love Movement"". I was really into music back then, even at an early age, but it was something about the jazzy beats and smoothness that attracted me to Tribe with the song ""Find My Way"". My Mom ordered me the CD from BMG music (yall remember that?) and I still have and listen to the CD. As I grew, I found they had older and even better music as I reached teen years and got into more of their music with the LimeWire, and Kazaa days. It's something about Tribe that I can't just explain. They are like that mythical figure that just doesn't seen real. I'm a huge fan and I'm trying to be as unbiased as possible with this review.

he north of Britain now officially starts in Leicestershire, according to a new study.
The UK’s population centre has moved from Upper Midway in Derbyshire to Snarestone in Leicestershire, experts at Liverpool University have said.
The shift is due to an increasing number of people moving south east for better employment opportunities, they added.
Areas around London and the south east have seen a constant increase in population between 1971 and 2011, researchers said.
However, large northern cities, including Birmingham, Newcastle and Glasgow, have seen more people leave according to five Censuses carried out over 40 years.
The study, coordinated by PopChange, used the population data gathered to identify the UK’s most densely populated areas – and pinpoint the boundary for the north-south divide.
All of these areas were in London, with the most densely populated area being Westminster, followed by Earls Court.
Outside of London the most densely populated area over this period was Spinney Hills in Leicester.
Chris Lloyd, Professor of Quantitative Geography at the University of Liverpool’s, who led the project, said: “Our study of population changes in Britain finds that the population centre for each Census has moved steadily further south from Upper Midway in Derbyshire to Snarestone in Leicestershire, as the population of the country has shifted towards the South East.
“This reflects a north-south divide in population growth, with more rapid growth in London and the south east of England than elsewhere.
“However, we also discovered that many heavily populated urban areas that had experienced very large population decreases during the 1970s have largely recovered, particularly since 2001, and are now back at, or exceed, the levels they were at in 1971.
“This urban growth links to opportunities, such as in employment, but also to challenges such as increasing overcrowding seen in outer London and other urban areas.”",source_text/3582cee726c43685defe1250a34cd4c73d72579b19c53a1474039ba95baa32a2-bing_chat_0_0.txt,"The north of Britain now officially starts in Leicestershire, according to a new study.The UK’s population centre has moved from Upper Midway in Derbyshire to Snarestone in Leicestershire, experts at Liverpool University have said.",complete_support,False,leicestershire - north - midlands - starts - yorkshire - england - northern - liverpool - officially - tees,StanfordCitation,0.7,0.5333333333333333,0.49,0.41,[0.9294713139533997],[0.9294713139533997]

So grab your compass and map and don your hiking boots. It’s time to climb.
5 January 2023
When it comes to sheer size, the United Kingdom is on the smaller side of average as far as nations go. For context, eleven US states are larger than the UK, the nearest in size being Michigan. And yet, this small nation punches well above its own weight in geological and topographical diversity. In terms of mountains, it’s home to an impressive variety. Sure, there aren’t any 8,000ers to summit, but the UK’s highest mountains are marvels in their own right.
First, let’s introduce our host, the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, better known as the UK. As the name suggests, it comprises Great Britain and Northern Ireland. And, for completeness, Great Britain – or just ‘Britain’ – is made up of England, Scotland and Wales. To confuse matters, there is also the British Isles, which includes Ireland.
There are many classification systems for mountains in Britain and the British Isles, but there does not seem to be one for the UK’s highest mountains as a whole. They are, however, all listed as part of the Marilyns, a list of mountains and hills in the British Isles with a prominence of 490 feet and over. We’ll be looking at the highest mountains in Britain and the UK by country, including the highest mountain in the UK.

When it comes to the highest peaks in the UK, Scotland is king. Not only is it home to the highest mountain in the UK, but also to the ten top highest mountains in Britain. Indeed, it’s the only country in the UK with mountains exceeding 4000 feet, of which it has nine. And which is the highest of them all? Why, Ben Nevis of course. Here they are listed by height:
- Ben Nevis – 4,411.1 feet
- Ben Macdui – 4,295 feet
- Braeriach – 4,252 feet
- Cairn Toul – 4,236 feet
- Sgòr an Lochain Uaine – 4,127 feet
- Cairn Gorm – 4,084 feet
- Aonach Beag – 4,049 feet
- Aonach Mòr – 4,004 feet
- Càrn Mòr Dearg – 4,003 feet
- Ben Lawers – 3,983 feet

Standing at 4,411 feet high, Ben Nevis is the tallest mountain in the United Kingdom. Home to a variety of wildlife, including red deer, golden eagles, and ptarmigans, the area around the mountain also includes numerous archaeological sites, including cairns, stone circles, and Iron Age hillforts. It’s located in the Grampian Mountains in the Scottish Highlands and has been climbed by many notable figures including Sir Edmund Hillary and David Grey.
Despite its height, Ben Nevis is widely considered an easier mountain to climb than other high peaks in the region, with many routes leading to the summit. However, the weather on Ben Nevis can be very unpredictable, so climbers need to be prepared for all conditions.

Snowdon is the highest mountain in Wales and the highest peak in the UK outside the Scottish Highlands. Located in the Snowdonia National Park in the northwest of the country, it rises to 3,560 feet above sea level
Snowdon, or Yr Wyddfa in Welsh, is the most popular mountain in the United Kingdom for hillwalkers, and the busiest mountain in Wales. It’s estimated that around half a million people walk to the summit each year. The 21-mile-long Snowdon Horseshoe path skirts the edges of 11 peaks including Snowdon itself. Other notable summits on this route include Garnedd Ugain (3,494 ft) and Crib Goch (3,028 ft).

All of England’s tallest mountains are located in the Lake District, including its tallest, Scafell Pike. Standing at 3,209 feet, Scafell Pike is the 137th tallest mountain in the United Kingdom and has a long and rich history. It’s been climbed by everyone from royalty to literary figures, and has been the scene of a number of famous events. The mountain is also steeped in legend, with stories of ghosts, giants, and buried treasure.
Scafell Pike is part of the Scafell massif, which also includes the peaks of Sca Fell and Ill Crag.
A popular destination for walkers and climbers, there are several routes to the summit, most of which are challenging. The mountain is also home to a number of wildlife species, including red deer, mountain hares, and peregrine falcons.

At an elevation of 2,796 feet, Slieve Donard is the tallest mountain in Northern Ireland. It’s also the 314th highest peak in the UK. Slieve Donard is part of the Mourne Mountains, which are a range of granite mountains located in County Down in the southeast of Northern Ireland. The mountain is named after Saint Donard, who was an early Christian missionary to Ireland.
The mountain is popular with hikers and climbers, and there are a number of routes to the summit. The most popular route is the Glen River Route, which follows the Glen River up to the base of the mountain.

This attempt to solve the so-called West Lothian Question has been seen as necessary due to the asymmetrical nature of devolution in Britain. However, in July 2021 it was abandoned, just six years after being introduced. So why did English Votes for English Laws (EVEL) fail?
What is the West Lothian Question?
The West Lothian Question was named after the long-serving Labour MP for West Lothian, Tam Dalyell. This was because he consistently highlighted an issue in the 1970s when devolution was being considered. The West Lothian question refers to the situation in which a Welsh, Scottish or Northern Irish MP can vote on a matter that will only effect constituencies in England but the reverse is not true. In the House of Commons on 14th November 1977 he made this point in the debate over the Scotland Bill:
“For how long will English constituencies and English hon. Members tolerate not just Scots, Welsh and a number of Ulstermen but at least 119 hon. Members from Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland exercising an important, and probably often decisive, effect on English politics while they themselves have no say in the same matters in Scotland, Wales and Ireland? Such a situation cannot conceivably endure for long.”
Before devolution, no solution was found to this issue. Subsequently, following the acts of Devolution in 1998, there were a number of occasions when this had a significant impact:
Foundation Hospitals (2003) – Labour MPs voted against the Governments plans for foundation hospitals. This meant that English MPs voted against it by 1 vote. However, the motion passed due to Welsh and Scottish Labour MPs voted for it, even though the new Hospitals would not be introduced in Scotland or Wales.
Tuition Fees (2004) – Tony Blair’s New Labour Government decided in 2004 to introduce ‘top up fees’ that university students would pay towards their own tuition. This was very controversial amongst the left-wing of his party and 71 Labour MPs rebelled against the change. However, the motion passed by 316-311 votes. This was because Scottish Labour MPs voted for the motion even though it would have no impact in their own constituencies.
This was very clearly a problematic constitutional issue.
What did the McKay Commission find?
A commission was set-up by the Coalition government to investigate how successful devolution had been since 1998 and to suggest solutions to potential problems. This commission was headed by Sir William McKay and published its findings in 2013. The report considered a number of potential approaches to the West Lothian Question:
Abolishing Devolution – “The abolition of devolution outside England does not, for example, appear a proportionate, feasible or desirable means to remove some of the causes of dissatisfaction felt in England.”
Maintaining the Status Quo – “Nor are we persuaded that maintaining the status quo is a desirable option. Supporters of this position, among them Professor Vernon Bogdanor, argue that England has a de facto predominance in the UK anyway, has as a result “no need to bang the drum or blow the bugle”, and if given the opportunity to do so, could by virtue of that predominance destabilise the UK as a whole”
Strengthening Local Government – ” We have heard powerful arguments from across the political spectrum that a strengthening of local government in England may be a way of addressing and giving voice to English concerns. We recognise the force of these arguments. We do not, though, believe a strengthening of governance within England to be a sufficient response to an English Question which is about the governance of England as a whole.”
Adopting a Federal System – “A number of our witnesses and others submitting written evidence viewed federalism as a solution to the English Question. Federalism would involve the devolved jurisdictions existing as units of a UK federation alongside a federal unit (or units) in England. Often the precise nature of the federal system envisaged was elusive. There appear, though, to be two principal variants of federalism under discussion. The first envisages English regions as the federal units, the second England as a whole, represented by an English parliament with powers equivalent to those of the devolved legislatures…We see little merit in considering a federal system based in England on English regions and heard little evidence in support. We are conscious of the swingeing rejection of such an approach in the North East of England in 2004 when four-fifths of the regional electorate voted against establishing an elected regional assembly”
Creating an English Parliament – ” The establishment of an English parliament as an English component of a UK federation has a small number of vociferous advocates and, as noted above, has significant resonance in English public opinion. The great majority of evidence submitted to us on this issue was, however, set firmly against the idea of an English Parliament.”
The option that the Commission finally recommending was one that would see different procedures adopted in the House of Commons for bills that related directly to England.
“Other parliamentary approaches address the English Question through special procedures in the House of Commons for English laws, often known in shorthand as ‘English votes for English laws’…In our view the introduction of such procedures could help to defuse the dissatisfactions evident in public opinion in England by enabling concerns specific to England to be represented in an explicit way in the House of Commons. As this would be an adaptation of an existing institution it would not involve the upheaval, cost and likely destabilising effects of establishing a new institution”
This approach was adopted by the Conservatives and included in their General Election Manifesto in 2015:
“We will maintain the integrity of the UK Parliament by ensuring that MPs from all parts of the UK continue to deliberate and vote together, including to set overall spending levels. But we will change parliamentary procedures so that the detail of legislation affecting only England or England and Wales will be considered by a Committee drawn in proportion to party strength in England or England and Wales. add a new stage to how English legislation is passed; no bill or part of a bill relating only to England would be able to pass to its Third Reading and become law without being approved through a legislative consent motion by a Grand Committee made up of all English MPs, or all English and Welsh MPs.”
What was English Votes for English Laws?
Following the Conservative General Election victory in 2015 the new process, known as ‘English Votes for English Laws’ was introduced:
Under this process a number of new procedures were added to the legislative process:
- After a bill went through First Reading the Speaker would certify whether it was an ‘English Only’ issue. Importantly, this did not apply to the whole bill, but could be broken down into separate clauses.
- The Bill would carry on through Second Reading, Committee Stage and Report Stage as normal.
- The Speaker would then review the bill to consider whether changes had been made to the ‘English Only’ status of any parts of the bill.
- The Bill would then go to a special Legislative Grand Committee. This could only be sat on by English MPs. They had the power to amend clauses, but not to veto them.
- The bill would then progress to the Third Reading.
- At this point, the whole house could then vote again on the bill.
What evidence is there that English Votes for English Laws did not work?
In July 2021 EVEL was abandoned. The Leader of the House of Commons, Jacob Rees-Mogg said EVEL had “added complexity and delay to the legislative process” whereas the SNP called it a “”utter, utter humiliation” for the Conservative Government.
There are some prominent arguments against EVEL:
- It can be argued that it created two-tiers of MP. The SNP argued that it made them ‘second-class’ MPs.
- It was hugely complicated and involved a number of new stages to the legislative process.
Perhaps the most significant problem it had was on actually defining what was an English-Only issue. This can be seen in the Enterprise Bill in 2016. This a wide ranging bill looking to reform elements of commercial retail in the UK. It dealt with a number of issues, one of which was opening hours for shops. This is a devolved issue in Scotland, however, changing it would also impact the employment rights of Scottish citizens, which was a reserved matter. The SNP therefore said they had a vote to on the clause that would have seen English shops allowed open for longer hours on a Sunday. However, despite the clause in the Bill failed by 317-286 because the SNP voted against it at Third Reading.
Where does it leave the West Lothian Question?
The problem with this is that the West Lothian Question is back to where it was in 2015. Just like with tuition fees, there is likely at some point to be a significant government defeat because devolved MPs vote on something that will not impact their constituents directly. At that point, the constitutional arguments over the West Lothian Question will begin again and question marks over the English Question will persist.
Article Summary
English Votes for English Laws was an attempt between 2015 and 2021 to solve the long established West Lothian Question. It ultimately failed because it was extremely convoluted and it was difficult to establish when a bill was ‘English-Only’. Its abandonment however means that the West Lothian Question is back with no attempted mitigation.

A Short Account of the Destruction of the Indies [2] [3] ( Spanish : Brevísima relación de la destrucción de las Indias ) is an account written by the Spanish Dominican friar Bartolomé de las Casas in 1542 (published in 1552) about the mistreatment of and atrocities committed against the indigenous peoples of the Americas in colonial times and sent to then Prince Philip II of Spain . [1]
Bartolomé de las Casas explains in the prologue that his fifty years of experience in Spanish colonies in the Indies granted him both moral legitimacy and accountability for writing this account. [4] In 1516, Las Casas was granted the title of Protector of the Indians by Cardinal Cisneros after he submitted a report on their population decline due to harsh labor and mistreatment by colonial officials. [5] During the time when Las Casas served as the Protector of the Indians, several clerics from the Order of Saint Jerome attempted to reform systems which used the native populace as laborers. However, Las Casas found their attempts insufficient to protect the welfare of the Indians, and returned to Spain to appeal to the Spanish monarch in 1517. [6]
From 1517 to 1540, Las Casas traveled back and forth between Spain and Spanish colonies in Latin America numerous times, struggling to find a common ground between Spanish authorities and his own attempts to improve the conditions of Indian subjects in Spanish dominions. [4] One of purposes of his travels was to continue to protest Spanish colonial mistreatment of Indians.
In 1542, after Las Casas first wrote the chronicle later known as A Short Account of the Destruction of the Indies , during the hearings ordered by Charles V of Spain to resolve issues of forceful conversion and colonial exploitation of Indians, Las Casas presented the account before the members of the Council of the Indies as proof of atrocities committed upon Indians by colonial authorities. [6]
It was written for Prince Philip II of Spain . Las Casas appeals to the Prince's pathos throughout his account. One of the stated purposes for writing the account is his fear of Spain coming under divine punishment and his concern for the souls of the Native peoples. [4] The account is one of the first attempts by a Spanish writer of the colonial era to depict examples of unfair treatment that indigenous people endured in the early stages of the Spanish conquest of the Greater Antilles , particularly the island of Hispaniola . [4] De las Casas noticed that no matter where he visited, the Spanish were committing the same crimes. On the island of Hispaniola, the Spanish were herding people into a straw building and setting fire to it, burning the occupants alive. [8] In addition, ""they sent the Males to the Mines to dig and bring away the Gold, which is an intolerable labor; but the Women they made use of to Manure and Till the ground, which is a toil most irksome even to Men of the strongest and most robust constitutions, allowing them no other food but Herbage, and such kind of unsubstantial nutriment, so that the Nursing Women's Milk was exsiccated and so dryed up, that the young Infants lately brought forth, all perished."" [4] On Puerto Rico and Jamaica , he saw the Spanish, ""with the same purpose and design they proposed to themselves in the Isle of Hispaniola, perpetrating innumerable Robberies and Villanies as before."" and that ""These two Isles containing six hundred thousand at least, though at this day there are scarce two hundred men to be found in either of them."" [4] De las Casas also notes that what the Spanish were doing drove many natives to commit suicide. On Cuba , ""By the ferocity of one Spanish Tyrant (whom I knew) above Two Hundred Indians hang'd themselves of their own accord; and a multitude of People perished by this kind of Death"" and ""Six Thousand Children and upward were murder'd, because they had lost their Parents who labour'd in the Mines."" [4]
A Short Account of the Destruction of the Indies marks a significant moment in the way 21st century colonial Latin American historians would address world history. [9] By comparing what historians know today about colonial Latin America, with the descriptions and recommendations given by De Las Casas in A Short Account , they are able to understand more about Europeans biases, prejudices, and outlook on the colonization of the Americas. De Las Casas' A Short Account , was a revised history of the conquest, in the way that he includes facts that would aid him in his argument. [9] Political scientist Diego von Vacano argued De Las Casas' A Short Account , revealed the ways 16th century scholars used rhetoric to lobby for changes during the Spanish colonization of the Americas. [9] In his earlier writings De Las Casas advocated the defense of indigenous peoples by recommending the use of African slaves as an alternative to indigenous people, but later repudiated the suggestion and condemned both the enslavement of indigenous people and Africans. De Las Casas supported the overall Spanish colonial experiment in the Americas, while condemning the abuse of the indigenous people. [ citation needed ]
De Las Casas used the term ""New World"" to look at the Americas and Western hemisphere and did not use the term or idea of the ""ancient world"" as a way to describe Spain, Europe and the Eastern hemisphere. [9] This linguistic shift marked a transition in historical text and thought by moving away from the medieval view of geography and world history to a more modern view. [9] De Las Casas addressed the new population in the Americas and introduced it in a political way in addressing the Spanish King. [9] De Las Casas introduced and presented the people of the Americas in the context of the Spanish empire. [9]
De Las Casas is also noted as one of the first writers and thinkers to racialize the indigenous people of the Americas. [9] In his attempt to defend the indigenous people, he argues that they are part of the human race by describing their bodies, skin color, language and culture. [9] In A Short Account , De Las Casas racialized the indigenous people and created a new understanding for them in the context and hierarchy of European ideas of race. [9]
His account was responsible for the passage of the new Spanish colonial laws known as the New Laws of 1542 , which abolished native slavery for the first time in European colonial history and led to the Valladolid debate . [ citation needed ] This text was used as a way to convince the King of Spain of the cruelties caused by the Spanish Conquistadors. [10] As such, he did not focus on or mention the effects of disease as a cause of suffering for the native people. [10] Instead, De Las Casas focused on the suffering caused by the Spanish conquistadors so that the King would address the conquistadors' behavior. [10]
The account was republished in 1620, by Jan Evertszoon Cloppenburch , alongside the book Origin and progress of the disturbances in the Netherlands by Dutch historian Johannes Gysius . [1] The book was frequently reprinted, alone or in combination with other works, in the Netherlands and in other countries struggling against the power of Spain in Europe and the Americas. [1] The title in English, German, Dutch, and most languages, was manipulated to farther insist on the detrimental consequences of the Spanish conquest. [ citation needed ] The images described by Las Casas were later depicted by Theodor de Bry in copper plate engravings that contributed to the Spanish Black Legend .
A Short Account of the Destruction of the Indies has been acclaimed by scholars for its rhetorical effect. De Las Casas juxtaposes the inhumane mistreatment of the Spanish conquistadors with the inherent goodness of the indigenous people in an exaggerated manner in his strategy of persuasion. De Las Casas revised and re-edited this book in order to make his best argument in favor of the indigenous people.

So why is it in the headlines – and does it really do what it says on the tin?
T his month, two right whales in the Gulf of St Lawrence were found entangled in fishing gear. One, a female, was first spotted entangled off Cape Cod last year, but rescuers were not able to fully free her; the other, a male, is believed to have become entangled in the Gulf .
Hunted to near extinction before a partial whaling ban in 1935, North Atlantic right whales are once more critically endangered, with only 356 left. The main threat remains human contact: entanglement in fishing gear, and ship strikes. Fatal encounters, caused in part by the whales’ migratory shift into Canada’s snow crab grounds, have soared: more than a tenth of the population died or were seriously injured between 2017 and 2021, mostly in Canada and New England.
One of the threats they face is from the growing crab and lobster fisheries. The whales migrate from their calving grounds in Florida to feed in Canada – putting them on a collision course with the pots and traps.
“We’re talking millions of lines, placed in the water every year,” says Kate O’Connell, a marine wildlife consultant for the Animal Welfare Institute. “These animals are running the gauntlet – and it’s getting harder and harder for them to survive.”
When a whale gets entangled, ropes from buoys on the surface to the seabed traps can become embedded in its skin, weighing it down and leaving it unable to swim or feed properly, leading to a “really traumatising death”, O’Connell says.
But what makes it even more concerning to conservationists is that some of the fisheries they say threaten the right whale were certified as “sustainable” by the world’s largest fisheries certification programme: the Marine Stewardship Council .
The MSC, which grants the right to use its well-known “blue tick” label on products, has grown from 315 certified fisheries in 2017 to 421, representing 14% of all global fish landings. In the last year its labelled products were worth $12bn (£9.5bn). In the absence of governments looking after our oceans, “the MSC is definitely the best we’ve got” in terms of consumer labels, according to Ruth Westcott of the environmental alliance Sustain.
The MSC hit the headlines in March, however, when the controversial Netflix documentary Seaspiracy accused it of certifying fisheries with a high level of “bycatch” – whereby species such as dolphins and turtles are caught in fishing nets – and said its certification was too easily achieved.
The MSC denied the allegations and, alongside several other organisations, accused the film-makers of making “misleading” claims . The producers deny this.
But the plight of right whales shows how fine a line the MSC has to walk, between conservationists and the fishing industry, and has reignited a fierce debate over what it means when you see a blue MSC label on a fish package in the supermarket.
Certainly, the presence of MSC-certified fisheries along the migration route of one of the world’s most endangered mammals has become emblematic of the contradictions the organisation has to confront. Even one dead whale a year brings the species closer to extinction.
Another ecolabel, from the conservation group WWF, takes a different tack. This month, WWF Hong Kong revised its seafood guide to downgrade “Boston lobster”, the generic Chinese term for all two-clawed American lobster species, to “red/avoid” because its harvesting grounds overlap with the habitat of North Atlantic right whales.
Why then, conservationists say, would MSC give any fishery in the right whales’ range the green light to fish there?
Critics also argue that the very nature of the MSC’s model, with fisheries paying to be certified, poses a conflict of interest.
Is the MSC, the world’s biggest fisheries certification scheme, still fit for purpose?
The heart of the matter may come down to the fact that the MSC exists not just to protect the environment but also to ensure thriving fisheries.
Rupert Howes, MSC chief executive, says it is about “resource management”, not pure conservation.
“We’re passionate about oceans and marine ecosystems and ocean resilience,” he says, “but we’re also deeply concerned about global food insecurity and indeed the 500m livelihoods the FAO [UN Food and Agriculture Organization] estimate depend on the global seafood industry.”
He admits that the organisation is “not perfect”, and says the level of criticism is “difficult”.
“There’s a tendency for everybody to want us to resolve their particular issues,” Howes says. “And there’s a limit. We’re already complex and costly compared with other assurances.” He is at pains to point out what the MSC does well: “Nothing carries the label without traceability. Nothing carries the label without a recertification every five years, and the audit every year.”
He argues that the MSC system is vastly superior to the industry self-certifying; he also notes that, while some organisations are promoting improvement projects, many have no traceability, action plan or outcome. Unlike some other ecolabels, with “desk-based research”, Howe says, the MSC works with fisheries to “drive improvements”.
“Stakeholders sometimes feel because we’re working with the markets that it’s compromised, but it isn’t,” he says.
To be certified by MSC takes up to 18 months. First, a fishery is assessed by independent “conformity assessment bodies” (CABs). They visit the fishery, consult experts and consider all available data to decide whether it meets MSC criteria. There are several checks and balances, including third-party monitoring of the CABs and an independent evaluation of the assessment. In addition, environmental organisations can object to certification, which often results in additional conditions placed on fisheries.
Sixteen of its 421 fisheries are currently suspended, including the Gulf of Maine lobster fishery and the Gulf of St Lawrence snow crab fishery, which has now withdrawn from the MSC altogether. In the past five years, a quarter of all new assessments ended without certification. But since 2001, MSC said it had received 51 objections before certification, which resulted in three fisheries not being certified.
Howes believes the market model is driving a more sustainable ocean. “The MSC is just trying to empower consumers to do their part to reward, in our mind, the ones that are doing the right thing.”
But the right thing means different things to different people. Scores of organisations have expressed concern that the MSC’s certification process does not properly account for bycatch, particularly of sharks and cetaceans. In 2018, a group of 66 conservation groups and academics accused the MSC of not paying enough attention to the protection of species not specifically targeted by fisheries.
Conservationists argue the MSC lacks a “gut check” on endangered species – and right whales are a good example. In 2017, due to threats to endangered species, O’Connell and 53 international organisations urged the MSC to reassess a number of fisheries, including the Gulf of Maine lobster fishery. The same year, the MSC suspended a “sustainable” snow crab fishery , the Gulf of St Lawrence, after right whales were found dead in its fishing gear. But it did not suspend the lobster fishery until 2020, after the federal judge had ruled that US fishing authorities had overlooked the impact of lobster fisheries on right whales.
The MSC argues that certification is “part of the solution” to right whale entanglement because it drives good practice, such as monitoring and taking steps to avoid interactions. In the case of the right whales, the CABs that certified the fisheries in question have said there is “no evidence” of them causing a threat, and that it imposed conditions on some to “monitor and reduce the risk”.
Since the Gulf of St Lawrence deaths and suspension in 2017, “there have been no reports of right whale deaths within an MSC certified fishery”, according to the MSC. Its fisheries used colour-coded gear, it said, to identify which fishery was responsible for any entanglements that occur, and if issues arose it could audit and investigate quickly.
Last month, however, a paper co-authored by Amy Knowlton, a senior scientist at the Anderson Cabot Center for Ocean Life at the New England Aquarium, reported an alarming reduction in the size of right whales , suggesting their stunted growth could be the result of hauling around fishing gear. It is estimated that 85% of right whales have suffered at least one entanglement.
“A lot of fisheries are in denial they are part of the problem,” says Knowlton. One of her biggest concerns, she says, is the “need to get this firm evidence before a fishery will do anything. We don’t know where the majority of these entanglements occur but we do know they occur throughout the range.”
Today, six lobster and snow crab trap and pot fisheries within the right whales’ range remain MSC-certified as “sustainable”. But none of them should be, in O’Connell’s opinion, given the cumulative risk from multiple fishing lines. The MSC’s guidelines “remain weak”, she says, and are in desperate need of a thorough review.
The MSC says it is doing just that: undertaking a review of the fishery standard on which it bases its certification.
As part of the review, it has proposed a “more precautionary approach” to endangered, threatened and protected (ETP) species, says Rohan Currey, the MSC’s chief science and standards officer. Every marine mammal, reptile, amphibian and seabird would now all be regarded as ETP species, “irrespective of how abundant it is”.
This would, says Currey, trigger a condition for certified fisheries to reduce its bycatch, or unintentional catch, of these animals.
He says the review will examine the possibility of including sharks and other species, and also look at requirements for independent data collection – for instance, using observers or electronic monitoring – as well as potentially broadening the criteria for cumulative risks to a fishery.
The review will end in 2022. However, because of the FAO’s rules allowing fisheries three years to comply, any changes would not be likely to take effect until at least 2023 for new fisheries – and 2025 for those already in the scheme.
In the meantime, the MSC’s own advisory council is growing concerned. Rory Crawford, of BirdLife International, one of the advisory council stakeholders, conducted a study of 23 fisheries in 2019 and found that only three were actively working to monitor and minimise bycatch .
“Consumers cannot be fully confident that certified fish comes without impacts on non-target species, from sharks to seabirds to whales,” he concluded.
Given that standards have not changed since 2019, he says, there are still MSC-certified fisheries that are not doing their best to minimise seabird bycatch, such as bird scaring or weighted lines.
“As a consumer purchasing a blue-tick product, I’d want to know that every effort was being made to minimise or even eliminate non-target bycatch, irrespective of whether it’s a ‘critically endangered’ Tristan albatross or ‘least concern’ common guillemot,” he says.
Ruth Westcott, campaign coordinator at the environmental alliance Sustain, says that in the absence of governments looking after our oceans, “the MSC is definitely the best we’ve got” in terms of labels. While the system has failed, it was “not all doom and gloom” for the consumer, she said. “As a consumer, you can buy from fishmongers or direct from a fishery – as close to the source as possible. Then look at the MSC or MCS rating scheme.”
Crawford notes that MSC certification has resulted in improvements for some fisheries, such as the Namibian hake, where seabird bycatch fell by 90% . He wants the MSC to require independent data, as well as explicit requirements that fisheries minimise bycatch of species of “least concern”, such as eider ducks and northern Fulmars, which fisheries catch in their thousands.
WWF, which co-created the MSC scheme two decades ago, is perhaps the highest-profile organisation calling for it to reform.
WWF has already lodged objections to several proposed certified fisheries, and says the MSC should be “more rigorous” in its standards, and needs to apply the “precautionary principle” as a matter of course. Last year, WWF and the Pew Charitable Trusts objected to the MSC’s certification of its first bluefin tuna fishery, saying it was too early to declare the stock fully recovered . An audit of the assessment of the fishery identified “minor nonconformity” issues, including around the impartiality of the CAB, which MSC said had since been addressed.
“I would not trust all of the fisheries to be sustainable,” says Giuseppe Di Carlo, WWF’s director of the WWF Mediterranean marine initiative. “WWF expects MSC to make reforms in the standard, and also in the assurance process, the implementation of standards.”
He says there is a conflict of interest at the heart of the scheme because the fisheries pay the CABs fees of $20,000 to $500,000 for the assessment. The MSC also charges retailers royalties of up to 0.5% of the net wholesale value of seafood sold, for using its label.
The MSC says any risk is mitigated by numerous reviews and consultations to ensure all the evidence is fairly and correctly interpreted. A formal objection process is also available for further scrutiny, it says.
In the meantime, it is likely to be four years before most fisheries will be pressed to make any improvements at all – assuming the MSC review even recommends they do so.
“Drastic changes are going on: increasing biodiversity loss, climate change, overfishing,” says O’Connell. “Right whales don’t have time for all this to be figured out. They’re coming to the point where they will hit a tipping point, and it will be too late.”
However, MSC insisted action was already being taken and said: “It is not a case of waiting for the outcome of the fisheries standards review to help right whales.”
As for the bigger picture, says Michelle Cho, a specialist in bycatch at the Anderson Cabot Center, the MSC needs to take a hard look at itself.
“There’s a lot of criteria they need to follow, there are the assessment bodies, and they have their guidance on how to score things,” says Cho. “But a lot of us feel that ‘gut check’ is not there.
“If things are cumulatively contributing to a species going extinct, is that really sustainable?”

D avid Willetts is a rare creature. Britain does not produce many public intellectuals. To find one lurking deep in the jungle of Westminster politics is little short of an anthropological miracle. But with this book, Willetts, a frontline Conservative politician, has confirmed his status as the thinking person's MP.
The Pinch sets out to show how the baby boomers – those, like Willetts, who were born between 1945 and 1965 – have ""stolen their children's future"" through their cultural, demographic and political dominance. Willetts does not quite succeed in proving this charge of intergenerational theft. But in marshalling his case he takes you on such a fascinating journey through British society that you do not feel remotely shortchanged.
His stated thesis is that the big generation of boomers has concentrated wealth, adopted a hegemonic position over national culture and failed to attend to the needs of the future. They have, in effect, broken the inter-generational contract. It is certainly true that the boomers have done well out of the welfare state, being set to take out, Willetts suggests, approximately 118% of what they'll put in. But this makes them no worse than previous generations, including those born between 1900 and 1920.
There is also no doubt that the monomaniacal British obsession with home ownership, while far from being a new phenomenon, has so far benefited the boomers rather more than the generations on either side. At the same time, the rise in immigration since the mid-1990s has held down wages for Generations X and Y (or those born between the mid-60s and the millennium) who would otherwise be benefiting from being in a smaller cohort and therefore a tighter labour market. It is also true that the boomers haven't been proactive enough on climate change – indeed, Willetts says too little about this – but it is hard to argue that they can be singled out on these grounds.
Willetts is unsure whether the boomers are a bad generation or just a big and lucky one. At one point, he insists that ""generational name-calling"" is unhelpful and that the issue at hand is simply a demographic one. But at other points, he labels the boomer generation a ""selfish giant"", which sounds like name-calling to me. The main problem facing him is the absence of hard data. There is good academic research in the US on ""inter-generational accounting"", but no equivalent here.
Willetts is candid about the fact that ""there are no authoritative estimates of the distribution of the £6.7 trillion of wealth in our country between the different age groups"" and relies instead on the assertion that ""there are good reasons to believe"" the boomers have got more than their fair share. There are some reasons to believe this, but it is also likely that the recent financial crash will alter any generational distribution of money, since the boomers are retiring just as the value of their pension assets has been sharply knocked down.
Willetts might have done better to take as his main theme the links between family, education and social mobility, since on these issues he is on firmer ground. In fact, his title could just as easily have been The Big Grab: How the Rich Are Using Money and Marriage to Buy the Future for Their Kids. His opening chapter is a tour de force, a brief, brilliant history of England's social architecture. He shows that far from being a modern invention, the nuclear family is a long-standing feature of Anglophone societies. (We are, he says, ""the first nuclear power"".) The idea that we used to live in big, warm, noisy My Big Fat Greek Wedding -type families is a myth. ""Think of England as being like this for at least 750 years,"" he writes. ""We live in small families. We buy and sell houses. We go out to work for a wage.""
The English have a private, market-based idea of property, in contrast to the familial property forms of our continental neighbours. Over a 44-year period in Leighton Buzzard, more than 900 houses changed hands. Two-thirds were sold to someone outside the family, rather than being passed down. The years in question? 1464 to 1508.
By contrast, the large familial networks of continental Europe act as the institutional anchor for property ownership and transmission, as well as for the formation of businesses and the provision of welfare. Willetts speculates that the property-managing function of French families may explain why romantic love there is more often associated with extramarital relationships. The orientation towards family-owned firms in Germany helps to explain the strength of the Mittelstand , the medium-sized, locally rooted layers of corporations.
Willetts does not at any point fall victim to the awful if-only-we-were-more-like-the-continentals lament. He does not want to alter our social DNA. But our particular social economy has two important consequences. First, the smallness of our families puts a greater emphasis on non-familial civic institutions. Small families need civil society more. This is why medieval guilds, trade unions and churches have played such an important role in our history.
Second, the welfare role of government is greater in a society marked by a highly privatised notion of property and small families. Breadwinning men are less likely to have family resources to fall back on, so need out-of-work benefits. This system worked reasonably well until the rise in divorce rates in 1970s and 1980s. Then, millions of women, many with dependent children, suddenly became reliant on the state. As Willetts puts it: ""A welfare system that was originally designed to compensate men for loss of earnings is slowly and messily redesigned to compensate women for the loss of men."" And everybody – but especially women – ends up poorer. This is why Willetts, certainly no reactionary, is so pro-marriage.
Strong parental relationships also influence children's well-being, which in turn affects the chances of upward social mobility, another of Willetts's preoccupations. Drawing on the very latest and best research, Willetts shows how the middle classes are tightening their grip on the opportunities available for the next generation. The professions are all but sealed off from the poor: ""The competition for jobs is like English tennis, a competitive game but largely one the middle classes play against each other.""
In general, this is a remarkably non-political book; David Cameron is mentioned just once. But Willetts does argue strongly for a vouchers scheme in education, weighted in favour of the poor, in order to break the middle-class stranglehold on the state education system. And the explanation for the flat-lining of social mobility brings Willetts back to social structures and, in particular, the trade-off between gender equality and class equality. The principal beneficiaries of the expansion of higher education have been the daughters of the middle class. Six per cent of girls born into low-income families in both 1958 and 1970 went to university; for girls born into richer households, the rate rose from 21 per cent to 36 per cent.
""Educational upgrading"" – the increase in the numbers of young people getting qualifications – accounts for 40 per cent of the fall in mobility for women between 1958 and 1970. This is, as Willetts says, a shocking statistic. The expansion of higher education, far from improving social mobility, has actually made it worse.
Women graduates marry male graduates and this trend towards ""assortative mating"" has increased in recent years, which means that on a household level, inequality is bound to rise. The narrowing of the gender gap seems to have widened the class gap. As Willetts puts it: ""Feminism has trumped egalitarianism."" And not just for one generation, either: just 5% of degree-educated mothers split up from their partner before their child's third birthday, compared with 42% of mums with no qualifications.
Willetts manages to synthesise these social trends into a coherent and engaging narrative, successfully mixing vignettes from South Park and The Simpsons with statistics from the British Household Panel Survey. Most important, when it comes to social and economic research, Willetts really does know his stuff.
David Cameron has lately been engaging fruitfully with external political thinktanks (including, I should say, Demos). This is greatly to his credit. Let's hope he recognises that in David Willetts he has a one-man thinktank right under his nose.
Richard Reeves is the director of Demos

The 1961 Major League Baseball season was played from April 10 to October 12, 1961. That season saw the New York Yankees defeat the Cincinnati Reds in five games in the World Series . The season is best known for Yankee teammates Roger Maris ' and Mickey Mantle 's pursuit of Babe Ruth 's prestigious 34-year-old single-season home run record of 60. Maris ultimately broke the record when he hit his 61st home run on the final day of the regular season, while Mantle was forced out of the lineup in late September due to a hip infection and finished with 54 home runs.
In response to the proposed Continental League , the American League expanded by two teams in the first MLB expansion since 1901. The original Washington Senators moved to Minnesota and became the Minnesota Twins . The American League therefore placed a new team in Washington, also called the Senators . Also, the American League placed a team in Los Angeles called the Los Angeles Angels .
In order to keep its schedule balanced, the American League season was extended by eight games. Previously, teams had played 154 games (22 games per opponent), but from 1961 AL teams would play opponents 18 times each for a total of 162 games. The National League played a 154-game schedule for the final time in 1961 before switching to 162 games when they also expanded to ten teams for the 1962 Major League Baseball season .

One such painting is ""The Pink Peach Tree,"" which depicts two pink peach trees against a blue and white sky. Another painting, ""Pink Peach Trees,"" was created in 1888 and features the same subject matter. Van Gogh painted this work when the fruit trees in Arles were blooming, and he produced fourteen paintings of them during this time. The painting is known for its energetic brushstrokes, vibrant palettes, and free-flowing style.","Another painting, ""Pink Peach Trees,"" was created in 1888 and features the same subject matter.","By early 1888 the situation between Van Gogh and his brother Theo had become desperate, and their living arrangement impossible. The Paris that hod at first so attracted Van Gogh he now found stultifying and claustrophobic. In a letter to Theo he explained, 'It seems to me almost impossible to work in Paris unless one has some place of retreat where one can recuperate and get one's tranquillity and poise back'. On 20 February 1888 Van Gogh visited Seurat's studio with Theo for the first and last time, and afterwards boarded a train to Arles in the south of France. Armed with the preconceived idea that the south was an artistic Elysium full of warmth, peace and exotic colours, Van Gogh wrote to Gauguin , 'I always remember the emotions the trip from Paris to Arles evoked. How I kept watching to see if I had already reached Japan! Childish isn't it?' Ironically, when he did arrive in Arles it was cloaked in snow, but as the snow melted the trees burst into bloom, and his notions of the south were for a short time born out.
